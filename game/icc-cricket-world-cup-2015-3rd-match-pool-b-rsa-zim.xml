			<line><![CDATA[So, that's all we have from this game. South Africa next play the current champions India on February 22, whereas Zimbabwe will lock horns with UAE on February 19. However, the World Cup action won't stop before that. Switch tabs to follow the biggest rivalry in world cricket as the India-Pakistan game is all set for a thrilling finish. Don't miss out on all the high octane action there. From commentators <b>Akshay Maanay</b> and <b>Sidhant Maheshwari</b>, this is goodbye from here.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Chigumbura:</b> "I thought the opening bowlers gave us the right start that we needed. Maybe we went a bit too much towards the end, in the last three overs. It was going to be a gamble to bring maybe your top seamer Chatara, but in an other way he had bowled too many overs and it was bit of a gamble. I knew they had big-hitters at the end, so that's why I didn't bowl him in the middle period. Unfortunately, we didn't get the wickets in the middle period. So, we ended up paying the price at the end. I think we lost wickets at the wrong time, when Chibhabha was batting, when Masakadza was batting, we had the game in hand, but at the end of the day we lost those wickets and the pressure was back on us. I am happy with the performance today, I thought we were in the game for a longer period of time, than we normally do. So, these are good signs for the games to come on."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>AB de Villiers</b>: "Pretty happy with a good winning start. Certainly wasn't easy. A lot of credit to Elton and his boys. I thought they came out and played really good cricket. They put us under pressure from the word go. And bowled really well especially in the first 10-15 overs. It was just a great knock from David (Miller) and JP (Duminy) today. Great partnership that won us the game today. So very chuffed for the two of them. It was pretty tough and it reminded me a bit of Zimbabwe's wickets (referring to their home surfaces) in the first 10-15 overs. Quite slow and difficult to hit through the line, but I thought the boys assessed pretty well. I got a little partnership going with Faf (du Plessis), but unfortunately both of us got out. Luckily David and JP got together and formed a great partnership. It definitely got easier towards the end of our innings. I think it played pretty well throughout their innings. They batted pretty well, but just lost their way halfway through the innings. Credit to my boys. The bowlers stuck together really well as a unit and especially Imran Tahir tonight was outstanding. I always feel the pressure,it is part of the game, it is the probably the reason why we enjoyed so much. Without the pressure we wouldn't be playing this game. We love it, love the big moment, love the pressure situations. That is actually what we spoke about in the last drinks break. We were under the pump and if don't do something about it, we are going to lose this game. That's great, we came out on top today. Sometimes you don't, but we learned from certain spells tonight. We learned a few lessons and we will take that forward into the next game. Obviously when I got out, I was just forming a nice partnership out there and just got things going with David and I don't know what happened there. It was quite frustrating. I will try not to do that again (referring to a question asked on Twitter, regarding which was the most frustrating moment in the game)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Miller:</b> "The first one will always be very special, but it was nice to top it up within the next couple of innings, so yes very ecstatic. I was just looking to construct a partnership with someone and JP was the man today. He batted phenomenally well. It was a tough wicket, was a little slow and eased on towards the end. So we just had to work in the middle, which JP (Duminy) did really well and myself. It was really nice to get that. We just kept encouraging each other along our way, we just tried to stay in the moment as much as we could. We knew it was an important partnership and tried to take it as deep as possible. That's what we did. A lot of positives I can take from that, I really enjoyed constructing the innings and I have been really working hard at that part of my game. Especially playing the spinners and rotating the strike. I am really happy with that performance, hopefully, it can continue."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>David Miller</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his 92-ball 138.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Zimbabwe might have lost this game, but they shouldn't lose hope. The way they are playing, they can well cause an upset in the next few games. They proved it when they had NZ on the mat in the first warm-up, defeated Sri Lanka in the second and put up a spirited performance today. On the other hand, South Africa will know that they managed to win the game, but it was not that convincing. Their top-order completely failed today and the way Steyn took a beating, they need to pull their socks up if they are to win the World Cup.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[What came next was the Miller-Duminy show. They put on a record <b>256-run stand</b>, the <b>highest 5th wicket</b> stand in ODI cricket. Both of them were considerate during the first half of their innings, playing balls on their merit, but after they got to their fifties, they cranked up to top gear. Both of them registered their respective hundreds and the onslaught was so fierce that 146 runs came off the last 10 overs, with 96 coming off the last 5. Riding on the Miller-Duminy charge, South Africa posted a mammoth 339/4 on the board.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, South Africa got off to a very poor start, losing both de Kock and Amla when the team total was 21. South African captain, de Villiers and du Plessis then tried steadying the innings. However, after some initial success against the Zimbabwean bowlers, both of them threw there wickets away in quick succession to leave South Africa struggling at 83/4. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Soon after, Taylor perished as well and the rest of the lower-order batsmen couldn't do much either. All of them got out while trying to up the ante. The Proteas bowlers were hot and cold. They looked out of sorts when Masakadza was batting, but came back well to halt the run-chase. Credit also goes to AB de Villiers for being spectacular in the field, taking 3 catches, out of which 2 were spectacular and effecting one run-out.]]></line><line><![CDATA[After losing Raza early in the run-chase, Chibhabha and Masakadza put on a 100-plus stand to stabilize the innings. Even after Chibhabha got out, Masakadza and Taylor decided to take on the South African bowlers, upsetting their line and lengths from time to time. Zimbabwe at one stage were 191/2 in the 33rd over, but after Masakadza got out, Zimbabwe's fight started to fizzle out. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[48.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Chatara, <b>out</b> Caught&Bowled!! Tame dismissal! <b>South Africa win by 62 runs.</b> Morne performs the final rites of the innings.

Full toss on off, Chatara pushes it to the left of Philander and takes off for a single, Kamungozi is not interested and sends his partner back. Philander shies and fails to hit the stumps, Chatara had given up]]></line><line><![CDATA[47.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philander to Chatara, no run, fuller and outside off, Chatara drives and gets an under-edge to the keeper]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Tafadzwa Kamungozi, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[47.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philander to Solomon Mire, <b>out</b> Caught by de Villiers!! Gosh! How can you keep ABD out of action? He seems to be everywhere. That is another stunner from the South African skipper. It was a short delivery, Mire fetches it from outside off and pulls it to deep mid-wicket, ABD sprints across the outfield, dives full length to his right and takes it centimeters from the ground. He was parallel to the ground when he took it. <b>Solomon Mire c de Villiers b Philander 27(25) [4s-2 6s-2]</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Philander to Solomon Mire, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Vernon Philander [7.0-0-25-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, 1 run, pitched up on off, Mire drills it down the ground, ABD limits it to just a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, no run, Morne keeps it just inside the tram-line outside off, Mire is nowhere close to connecting with that]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, <b>wide</b>, sprays it well wide of off, Mire tries to reach it, can't and wided by the umpire]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, no run, drags the length back and slows it up, Mire is early into the pull, the ball beats the outside edge]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, no run, takes the pace off the ball, Mire goes for the slog towards cow corner, fails to make contact]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, no run, fullish and outside off, Mire has a go at that, but it is too far away from him]]></line><line><![CDATA[The umpires call for a replacement and the fourth umpire comes out with a case of used balls.]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Morkel to Solomon Mire, <b>SIX</b>, that is out of the stadium!

Pin-point yorker aimed at the base of middle stump, Mire brings his bat down and squeezes it off the outside edge to third man. Steyn was a bit sloppy in collecting the throw and the batsmen sneak in an extra run]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[43.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Solomon Mire, 1 run, googly that just stops on the batsman, Mire checks his punch, lobs it to the right of Tahir and down to long-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Tendai Chatara, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[43.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Panyangara, <b>out</b> Caught by de Villiers!! Another fabulous catch from ABD! He makes them look so easy. The googly that bounced a bit extra, Panyangara goes on his knee and top-edges the sweep, the ball flies towards short fine, ABD runs across from slip, dives full length and gobbles it up.

Zimbabwe are falling apart! It was a 141kph short delivery, Ervine is hurried onto the pull, he ends up splicing it to mid-on, where ABD takes the simplest of catches. After a dreadful start to his spell, Steyn has come back well in the last couple of overs. <b>C Ervine c de Villiers b Steyn 13(21) [6s-1]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Steyn to C Ervine, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[42.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to C Ervine, no run, slower ball just outside off, Ervine goes for the slog across the line and misses, is outdone by the lack of pace]]></line><line><![CDATA[42.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to Solomon Mire, 1 run, short of length on off, Mire was cramped for room, but still gets the pull away to deep mid-wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[42.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to Solomon Mire, no run, fullish and outside off, Mire drives it towards extra cover, Amla makes a slight fumble, but the duo don't risk the single]]></line><line><![CDATA[42.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to Solomon Mire, no run, cross seam delivery, it was a yorker, Mire manages to bring his bat down and dig it back down the wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[42.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to C Ervine, 1 run, Ervine makes room and Steyn follows him, Ervine jams it onto the pads and the ball trickles towards square leg]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[41.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Solomon Mire, no run, slower and close to off, Mire pushes it to cover off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[41.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Solomon Mire, no run, once again the wrong 'un, Mire goes for the drive and gets it off the inside part to short mid-wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[41.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Solomon Mire, no run, another googly, Mire goes for the mighty slog, gets an inside edge that hits QdK's pad and rolls to short third man]]></line><line><![CDATA[41.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Solomon Mire, no run, flighted on off, Mire drives it to cover, straight to the fielder]]></line><line><![CDATA[41.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Solomon Mire, no run, wrong 'un that breaks back in, Mire does not pick it, he misses the forward defensive and the ball goes off the pad to short third man, it was going down leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[41.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to C Ervine, 1 run, quicker and around off, keeps a bit low, Ervine bunts it down to long-on]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Imran Tahir [7.0-0-27-2] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to C Ervine, leg byes, 1 run, shortish on middle, Ervine tries to pull with one leg in the air, he misses and the ball hits him high on the pad and drops to the off-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Solomon Mire, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steyn to Chigumbura, <b>out</b> Chigumbura Run Out!! You cannot take on ABD and get away with it. Chigumbura does that mistake and pays the price for it. It was a full toss from Steyn, Chigumbura drives it to mid-off and sets off for a risky single, ABD gathers the ball and hits the bulls-eye at the non-striker's end. He was out by a mile and it was the easiest decision for the TV umpire. <b>Chigumbura run out (de Villiers) 8(7) [6s-1]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Steyn to Chigumbura, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Run Out!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[The third umpire called in for a run-out chance.

If it was Corey Anderson and Kane Williamson in the first game, then Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Finn and James Taylor shone in the second. We are into the second day and it is time for another one of the contenders - South Africa to start their campaign when they take on Zimbabwe at Hamilton.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview:</b><br/><br/>One team is considered as one of the favourites of the tournament; the other isn't good enough to deserve consideration. Be that as it may, come Sunday when South Africa play their neighbours Zimbabwe in an ICC World Cup Pool B match at Hamilton's Seddon Park, there would be no dearth of excitement among expatriates from both countries.<br/><br/>There is a huge contrast in both teams' challenge. South Africa have gone into the past World Cups mostly as favourites but their best performances have been semi-final appearances in 1992, 1999 and 2007. Can they go all the way this time and shake off their "chokers" tag? That's the question on every South African's lips.<br/><br/>The Proteas turned in a mixed performance in the two warm-ups leading up to this day-nighter. They beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in a rain-curtailed contest before New Zealand, one of the pre-tournament favourites, brought them down several pegs by inflicting a 134-run defeat. The latter performance indicated amply that the South Africans haven't completely cast off their habit of absolutely falling apart on a bad day.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Zimbabwe, going in the tournament as the number 10 team in the ODI rankings, did very well in their warm-ups. In their match against New Zealand, they had reduced the hosts to 157 for 7 before rain brought the contest to a premature end. And then in their second game, they stunned 2011 World Cup finalists Sri Lanka by chasing down 280. Clearly, Zimbabwe are capable of spoiling a couple of parties and if they somehow could get the better of their much-superior opponents on Sunday, they could even begin dreaming of their maiden knockout appearance.<br/><br/>The importance of seasoned batsman Brendan Taylor's wicket and Zimbabwe's upset win against Australia in a triangular series last year weren't lost on South Africa captain AB de Villiers on the eve of the match. "He's [Brendan Taylor] just always been the thorn in the side for us growing up, and he's still a great player, and he's done so well in his career," De Villiers said on Saturday.<br/><br/>"Lots of credit to him, and we will witness his capabilities in tomorrow's game, and the other boys. Look, they beat Australia not long ago. They're a dangerous side."<br/><br/>South Africa are also looking over their shoulders over the fitness of batsman Farhaan Behardien who is battling a back injury. In case the 31-year-old fails to get fit in time, fast bowler Wayne Parnell could be drafted into the XI. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, face no such concerns. The pitch at Seddon Park is expected to be full of runs and when one adds up short boundaries to the equation, things look more harrowing for the bowlers.<br/><br/>Despite having stunned South Africa by 48 runs in the 1999 World Cup, Zimbabwe haven't won against them since 2000. That tells you how big the gulf is between the two teams.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Zimbabwe</b> (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Sikandar Raza, Brendan Taylor, Sean Williams, Solomon Mire, Elton Chigumbura(c), Chamu Chibhabha, Regis Chakabva(w), Craig Ervine, Tinashe Panyangara, Prosper Utseya, Tendai Chatara, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Stuart Matsikenyeri]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>South Africa</b> (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Vernon Philander, Aaron Phangiso]]></line>
