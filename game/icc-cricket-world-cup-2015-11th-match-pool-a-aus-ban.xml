			<line><![CDATA[Before we leave, it's our duty to remind you that it's going to be a Super Sunday tomorrow. There are two games, first <b>Sri Lanka</b> will lock horns with <b>Afghanistan</b> in Dunedin. The second game is the big one - <b>India</b> taking on <b>South Africa</b> at the MCG. It's going to be a cracker of a contest. Don't miss out on the action. Until then, take care. Hasta la vista!]]></line><line><![CDATA[So, both teams will share points and are now on <b>3 points each from 2 games</b>. Cyclone Marcia's intensity might have died down, but the downpour never stopped. It has been raining in Brisbane for 3 days now. Australia will definitely feel a little hard done by with this washout, but there's still a long way to go in the tournament. On the other hand, Bangladesh will definitely be the happier side today and this point could well decide their destiny of getting through to the next round. This result could also have serious implications for teams like England, who are languishing at the bottom of the table with a very poor net run-rate. That's all we have from here.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>16:42 Local Time, 06:42 GMT, 12:12 IST:</b> Folks, what we feared for most part of the day has become official now. The game has been <b>abandoned</b> without a ball being bowled.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>16:20 Local Time, 06:20 GMT, 11:50 IST:</b> The chief groundsman reckons that he will need 2 hours to get the ground match-ready. However, the rain needs to stop first and we are slowly edging towards the cut-off time. We are running out of time here.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>16:00 Local Time, 06:00 GMT, 11:30 IST:</b> 'There's hardly any chance of play starting in the next couple of hours and that would mean that the game will be abandoned,' reckons <b>Mark Nicholas</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[I think all of you have a similar opinion regarding this controversial decision by the ICC. All of you believe that having the associates for the World Cup is the right way to go forward. I believe that none of you favour a 10-team tournament. Many thanks for all the answers. It's time for another question.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>15:35 Local Time, 05:35 GMT, 11:05 IST:</b> Chances of a 20-over game also look bleak as rain continues to fall at the Gabba.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>15:05 Local Time, 05:05 GMT, 10:35 IST:</b> Updates from the ground suggest that the rain has got much harder. It cleared briefly and there were indications of cricket being played this afternoon, but it has become very damp now. Things don't look promising at all.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Michael Slater</b>'s tweet: Frustrating sitting watching the rain fall in Brisbane!

The rain has become heavier and the groundsmen are also off the field. Looks like we are in for a longer delay.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>14:35 Local Time, 04:35 GMT, 10:05 IST:</b> The Australian team has reached the ground as the groundsmen continue to work on the outfield.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Folks, majority of you feel that Watson should be the one who can be omitted from the team, instead of Bailey. However, in case of a 20-over game, Bailey might get the nod ahead of Clarke himself, considering Bailey's game is more equipped for the shorter formats. In that case, Watson will definitely play. Well, it is a tough choice indeed. Thanks for your valuable comments. Let's move on to our next question.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>14:05 Local Time, 04:05 GMT, 09:35 IST:</b> The rain continues to fall at the Gabba. However, the groundstaff have made their way out on the field for some repair work. If the rain does stop, it should take about an hour and a half for play to get underway here. There are a few spectators out there, but it's a grim site. Interestingly, the groundstaff have started marking the sponsor logos, which weren't there previously. Fingers crossed!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>13:50 Local Time, 03:50 GMT, 09:20 IST:</b> There are no updates from the ground for now. So, it is safe to assume that the weather has not changed much.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>13:12 Local Time, 03:12 GMT, 08:42 IST:</b> There is more news coming in that the <b>cut-off time</b> for a 20-over game is <b>18:30</b> local time.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>13:05 Local Time, 03:05 GMT, 08:35 IST:</b> 'Well I can assure you everytime I have stepped out here, the rain has become heavier and it is coming down even harder now. The groundsmen did say that perhaps around 4 pm, we could have a match on here. The ground is draining well, there are no patches for now, but wind could definitely play a factor here,' reckons <b>Mayanti Langer</b>.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>12:51 Local Time, 02:51 GMT, 08:21 IST:</b> "It is very wet out there. Conditions were slightly promising for a while, but the rain has kicked back in," says <b>Mark Taylor</b>.]]></line><line><![CDATA[As we wait for more news from this game, you can switch tabs to follow the action between West Indies and Pakistan.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Weather Update</b>: The rain has eased for now, but there is enough downpour to delay the start. With rain expected throughout the day, it could well be a start-stop affair, if at all the rain stops.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There is news coming in that both the teams have <b>not left their hotel</b> for now. So, there will definitely be a delay.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[In the battle of the Asian nations, Bangladesh trumped Afghanistan by 105 runs. At one point, the Bangladeshis were struggling at 119/4 in the 30th over. With a poor run rate, things looked bleak for Bangladesh at that stage. But, the old warhorses, Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim put on 114 runs for the 5th wicket and gave Bangladesh some sort of respectability. At the end, Bangladesh were all out for 267, with the last 6 wickets falling for just 34 runs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Afghanistan's start was very poor as they were reduced to 3/3 at one point. With lack of experience in the international arena, it was only a matter of time before they folded in front of the Bangladeshis. Even though the 4th wicket partnership between Shenwari and Stanikzai crossed 50, the initial hiccups were too much for them to recover from and they were eventually bowled out for 162.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia come into this game on the back of a comprehensive 111-run win against arch-rivals England on the opening day of the World Cup. After Aaron Finch was dropped by Chris Woakes for 0, he made the English team pay dearly by notching up 135 off just 128 balls. Finch was well supported by fifties from Bailey, Maxwell and late cameos from Marsh and Haddin helped Australia post a mammoth 342 on the board.]]></line><line><![CDATA[In return, England could never get going and apart from James Taylor, who finished with 98*, the English batsmen failed to counter the seam and the bounce at the MCG. The Mitchells, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Marsh, finished with 9 wickets together. Mitchell Marsh picked up 5/33, his career best figures and England were bundled out for just 231 in the 42nd over.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Before we go any further, let's take a look at the recent form of both the teams.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The ICC yesterday released a statement that the match can still go ahead with a delayed start. However, in case of a washout, the ICC will provide ticket refunds to the people, who had bought the tickets earlier.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>12:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST:</b> Australia captain Michael Clarke's return to the international fold could well be delayed as Cyclone Marcia sweeps across the Queensland coastline. Even though the danger from the cyclone will reduce to a great extent by the time it reaches Brisbane, torrential rains have put a big question mark on the staging of the Australia vs Bangladesh game. A washout looms on the horizon and with no reserve days for pool games, both teams will share a point each in such a scenario.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b> Preview: </b><br/><br/>Marcia, a category five cyclone, has wreaked havoc along the coast of Queensland, and although it is expected to reduce to category one by the time it reaches Brisbane, it has already put the Group A clash between co-hosts Australia and Bangladesh in doubt. Michael Clarke, who is set to return to international cricket after a long break due to injury, might have to wait longer as the match at Gabba is likely to be affected by weather.<br/><br/>A 20-over contest is a possibility according to the ICC but talks of ticket refunds are already doing the rounds. This will be Australia's second match of the tournament after they won their opening clash against England in comfortable fashion. Bangladesh, who faced Afghanistan a few days back, emerged victors in their first match as well.<br/><br/>Venue: The Gabba, Brisbane<br/><br/>Date: February 21, 2015<br/><br/>Time: 0900 Hrs IST<br/><br/>Weather: Temperatures between 22-26C. Heavy rain.<br/><br/><b>Team news</b><br/><br/><b>Australia:</b><br/><br/>A missed opportunity proved costly for England as Aaron Finch made them pay with a fine century in Australia's opening match, while Glenn Maxwell and George Bailey also came good with the bat. However, the stand-in skipper might have to make way for Clarke, who has recovered from a hamstring injury he sustained during the Test series against India. In the bowling department, it was Mitchell Marsh who did the damage, picking up his maiden five-wicket haul, while Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc also got amongst the wickets.<br/><br/>While most of the batters did well, Shane Watson and Steven Smith failed to deliver and Australia will be hoping that their poor performance against England is just an aberration. Australia also have a concern with their spin bowling department with Maxwell and Smith going for a few in the same match. These issues apart, Australia have a strong line-up with their batting order extending up to No 10, while they also have eight players who can do a fair job with the ball.<br/><br/>Australia captain Clarke said the XI for the match has been decided, but did not reveal the combination as changes could be done at the last moment keeping a curtailed affair in mind. In case the game does take place, Bailey sitting out is almost a certainty, although there are reports that the Australian team management is having second thoughts about including Shane Watson. It is also reported that Pat Cummins could replace Josh Hazlewood, who had an ordinary outing in the previous game.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1. David Warner, 2. Aaron Finch, 3. Shane Watson, 4. Michael Clarke (capt), 5. Steven Smith, 6. Glenn Maxwell, 7. Mitchell Marsh, 8. Brad Haddin (wk), 9. Mitchell Johnson, 10. Mitchell Starc, 11. Pat Cummins.<br/><br/><b>Bangladesh:</b><br/><br/>Bangladesh were below par in their warm-up matches against Pakistan and Ireland and a top-order collapse left them in a lot of trouble against Afghanistan, before Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan bailed them out. Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah, who scored fine half-centuries against Pakistan, failed to deliver against Afghanistan, while the likes of Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque and Soumya Sarkar also did not contribute much. While the experienced pair of Shakib and Mushfiqur will be expected to play key roles in the batting department, Bangladesh will be hoping for the rest of the batters to provide solid support.<br/><br/>Skipper Mashrafe Mortaza was terrific with the ball against Afghanistan, finishing with figures of 3 for 20 in nine overs, while Shakib, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed and Mahmudullah also did a decent job. However, the bowlers will have a tough job going up against a formidable Australian batting order, and they will not have any margin for error.<br/><br/>Mortaza said Bangladesh would like to do away with the concept of "winning combination", which means a couple of changes are possible. They went in with eight batsmen against Afghanistan, but might look at a seven-four combination for this game. Mominul Haque might be the batsman to make way for left-arm spinner Taijul Islam.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1. Anamul Haque, 2. Tamim Iqbal, 3. Soumya Sarkar, 4. Mahmudullah, 5. Shakib Al Hasan, 6. Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7. Sabbir Rahman, 8. Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), 9. Taijul Islam, 10. Rubel Hossain, 11. Taskin Ahmed.<br/><br/><b>Watch out for:</b><br/><br/>The swashbuckling David Warner was off to a superb start against England, but his outing was cut short when a terrific delivery from Stuart Broad beat him for pace. The left-handed opener will be eager to bounce back with a commanding performance, and Bangladesh better get themselves ready to be sent on a leather hunt.<br/><br/>Anamul Haque, the 22-year-old right-handed opener, has a lot of talent and his batting ability has impressed all. The elegant batsman that he is, Anamul has not been able to translate it into useful contributions. It will do Bangladesh a lot of good if he looks at the World Cup as a platform to prove his abilities.<br/><br/><b>Quotes:</b><br/><br/>"As much as we would like to get out on that field and continue our form in the World Cup, we need to realise how bad this cyclone is and care most about the people of Queensland." - Michael Clarke.<br/><br/>"I think it is negative to think of only the one point (in case of an abandoned game). We are preparing to play a full match. We don't want to play a curtailed game as forming a team combination becomes harder." - Mashrafe Mortaza.<br/><br/><b>Stats:</b><br/><br/>It is close to 10 years since since Bangladesh last won an ODI against Australia. In the 19 games they have played so far, Bangladesh could emerge victorious only once - in the Natwest series match in Cardiff in June 2005. Michael Clarke and Mashrafe Mortaza are the only two active players who participated in that game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b> (From): Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Soumya Sarkar, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Sabbir Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Al-Amin Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Nasir Hossain, Taijul Islam]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b> (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, George Bailey, Xavier Doherty]]></line>
