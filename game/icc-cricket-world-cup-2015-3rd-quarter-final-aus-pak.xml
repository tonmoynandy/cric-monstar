			<line><![CDATA[So who will join South Africa, India and Australia as the fourth semi-finalist? Is it going to be New Zealand or West Indies? The action shifts to the Cake Tin tomorrow for the fourth and final quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup. Looking forward to your company then. Adios!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Wahab Riaz</b> spoke to Michael Slater after the game: "I tried my level best (smiles). Obviously we wanted to win this game. We tried to put the pressure on the Aussies but in the end they played really well. If it was 250 on the board, it really puts the pressure on the other team as well. In the end, 213 and a team like Australia, the conditions over here really suit them. We tried our level best. Maybe we could have put more effort into it and try to get them out. Thanks for that (when Slater told him that his spell was one of the best he had seen). I had a plan behind it and I know he's not playing the pull or hook shot really well these days (talking about bowling bouncers to Shane Watson in particular). So why not take a chance and why not put him under pressure! I know they like to play their shots as well and they don't leave that much. But the way he (Watson) batted, hats off to him. You plan something and you put the other player under pressure for two, three overs and suddenly you get a dropped chance (talking about Rahat Ali dropping Watson). But, it happens. We cannot blame anyone for that. The way we have played, it's a really good team effort. We were not playing cricket for one month or so before the World Cup. So the guys came in, just chipped in and they got used to the conditions really quickly. The way they played the whole tournament was really good. It's fantastic (talking about playing in Australia). The atmosphere, the conditions and the crowd, I just love it."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@BumbleCricket</b>: Significant innings from S Watson ...real tough at the start ....seeing it through that matters.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia walloped Pakistan despite Wahab Riaz and this is how <b>twitter</b> reacted:]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@Cricket_U</b>:  End of an era tonight. Pakistan going to lose its major player and major attraction in Shahid Afridi. Thanks Lala for all the entertainment.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@fwildecricket</b>: That was a really impressive & encouraging win for #Aus. They were challenged and they responded well.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@bhogleharsha</b>: Wahab Riaz provided a few moments for Pakistan, but a loss with 16 overs left tells you the other team dominated most of the game. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@glennmcgrath11</b>: Well played @CricketAus winning their quarter final over Pakistan. It was a lot tougher then the score suggests. Bring on the semi final!! ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@mohanstatsman</b>: Will this be the last time we saw Misbah-ul-Haq, Younus Khan & Shahid Afridi on the cricket field. End of an era? ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Clarke</b>: "Extremely happy. A really close game in the end. I thought our bowlers did a really fantastic job once again tonight. Our fielding was excellent and then credit to Pakistan and Wahab Riaz. The way he came out and bowled, certainly put us under pressure. I think that's as fast a spell as I've seen in a long time. It's important that we got a win and that's the pressure of the finals. You are under pressure the whole time whether with the bat or in the field with the ball. The way Shane Watson hung in there I thought was fantastic. Steve Smith looked classy once again today, so really proud of the boys. Well, you never like getting out for not many runs (smiles). I think if they had taken Watto (Shane Watson) at fine leg, it could have been a lot tighter. But credit to the way he stuck in there and again I thought Wahab bowled really well and certainly tested us out. They (India) are in good form, they are playing really well. MS Dhoni is leading them really well. Well it's certainly going to be a tough challenge. We have to be at our best. Our top three or top four have to bat a little bit better than we did tonight. But we look forward to another really tough contest at the home of cricket (Sydney Cricket Ground). We are looking forward to it. I think it's no different to any other game playing for Australia (when asked how Australia would mentally prepare for the semi-final of the World Cup). I've spoken a lot to the team about not setting the bar too high and not putting the World Cup on a pedestal. Because sometimes when you build something up so much, it's really hard to grab, really hard to win. So I think for us, it's about preparation as always. Everytime you walk out to bat or bowl for Australia you want to do your best and this game will be no different. The players will prepare well and we'll go and enjoy and we will go and play another great game for Australia."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Misbah</b>: "Obviously disappointing after losing the quarter-final. Obviously we want to win and progress in the tournament but Australia deserve that (the win). They bowled really well and when they came to bat they batted really well. I think at one stage 270-280 was pretty much on, but we just kept losing wickets and some bad shot selection cost us. He (Wahab Riaz) really bowled his heart out. He was totally a different sort of bowler throughout this tournament. And today the kind of spell he bowled, I have never seen a bowler bowling like that. If that catch (of Shane Watson) was taken, it could have been totally a different story. I am really happy with the way he bowled today. Especially happy with the bowlers (talking about his team's performance in the World Cup), I think, after losing the first two games, the way team came back and won four games on a row. We really need to improve our batting if we want to do well in the future. But I think overall, the team really did well in this tournament."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Hazlewood</b>: "It's great to be back in the side. I've been bowling well all week and it was good to put it into the game. It's quite a long tournament and you can come in and out of form. So I was quite happy to get a game today and quite happy with the result. The wicket was quite good, as we saw all game. To keep them to 213 was perfect for us and then the boys did well with the bat. We are going well in all aspects, our fielding has been outstanding in this tournament. We have been really working on it, so it's good for the result."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Josh Hazlewood</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his <b>4/35</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia will be brimming with confidence when they take on India in the semi-final at the SCG. It should turn out to be a mouth-watering contest between two form sides of the tournament. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[At the other end of the spectrum, it has to be said that Pakistan's batsmen showed poor shot selection. Despite getting starts, none of them were able to convert it into a big score. Haris Sohail top-scored with 41, but even he struggled for timing and placement. Their fielding and batting certainly let them down. Due to this gut-wrenching loss, Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi weren't able to end their careers on a high.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier, the bowlers put up a superlative performance to rip through the Pakistani line-up and put Australia in pole position. Mitchell Starc swung the new as well as the old ball to trouble the batsmen. Starc is in the form of his life for sure. Josh Hazlewood, with his unremitting accuracy and the ability to extract bounce, also made his mark by scalping four wickets. Even Maxwell chipped in with two wickets.]]></line><line><![CDATA[For a brief period, Riaz sent shivers down the spine of the batsmen by bowling a barrage of well-directed short deliveries. When he dug it short, Riaz generally bowled it head high and outside the off-stump. The left-armer's angle also troubled the opposition. The strategy paid rich dividends as he picked up the wickets of David Warner and Michael Clarke. He should have snared the wicket of Watson too, but Rahat Ali dropped a sitter at long leg and that perhaps was the turning point of the game. Poor Riaz, as Sohail Khan too dropped a catch to give Glenn Maxwell a reprieve. Maxwell made them pay by clobbering Pakistan's pacers with thunderous strokes as they hurtled towards a defeat.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Despite Wahab Riaz peppering the batsmen with vicious bouncers and taking a couple of wickets, Australia were able to chase down a modest target. It was Steven Smith, who played with poise and balance to shore up the innings. Shane Watson, who was troubled by Riaz's blistering pace early on also played his part by composing a crucial half-century. Australia with this victory have reached the semi-finals.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Australian dressing room is elated. The Australian public is happy as well. Good to see Wahab Riaz hug Glenn Maxwell. Now both teams shake hands. Clarke pats Watson on the back. Younis Khan hugs Shahid Afridi as well. Got to feel for Pakistan and Wahab Riaz. If only the batsmen scored 50-60 more runs, things could have been different. Well, this could well be the end of the ODI careers for Misbah, Younis and Afridi.]]></line><line><![CDATA[33.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohail Khan to Watson, <b>FOUR</b>, that's it! <b>Australia are in the semi-final and they will take on India at the SCG</b>. Pakistan are out of the tournament. Good length delivery outside off stump, Watson leans forward and drives it through cover. As soon as he hit the ball, he had his hands aloft in joy as he was running and then he hugs Maxwell. What a game this has been! So Australia lead 5-4 on head-to-head against Pakistan in World Cups]]></line><line><![CDATA[33.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohail Khan to Watson, no run, full and outside off stump, Watson drives it to mid-off, Maxwell wants a run but Watson isn't keen]]></line><line><![CDATA[33.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohail Khan to Maxwell, 1 run, slower ball on the leg stump, Maxwell works it to mid-wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[33.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohail Khan to Maxwell, <b>SIX</b>, a classy shot from Maxwell. Full and outside off stump, Maxwell backs away and carves it very hard over cover and it goes all the way. Australia are just one hit away now]]></line><line><![CDATA[33.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sohail Khan to Maxwell, 2 runs, full and down the leg-side, Maxwell glances it to fine leg, Riaz tidies up and the crowd boo him as he picks up the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Sohail Khan [7.0-0-44-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[32.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, no run, wooo! Bouncer on the off stump, Watson ducks under it and lets it go. Now Riaz runs up to the batsman and has a few words to say. Watson smiles back]]></line><line><![CDATA[32.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, no run, steeply rising short of length delivery outside off stump, Watson hops and defends]]></line><line><![CDATA[There is a man at leg slip now]]></line><line><![CDATA[32.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, <b>FOUR</b>, it's a fine little tickle and Australia get four more. Short of a length delivery down the leg-side, Watson gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Now Watson gives it back to Riaz. Umpire Dharmasena intervenes. Riaz and Misbah too weren't happy and they complained to the umpire]]></line><line><![CDATA[32.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Watson defends]]></line><line><![CDATA[32.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, <b>SIX</b>, take that, Wahab Riaz! Michael Clarke applauds from the dressing room, he loved it. Short and just outside off stump, Watson rocks and pulls, hits it very hard and it goes flat over the deep mid-wicket boundary]]></line><line><![CDATA[32.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, no run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Watson turns it to short leg]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Australia have scored 33 runs off the last 3 overs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[31.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, <b>SIX</b>, it's all the way this time. Short and on the leg stump, not quite pacy to trouble the batsman, Maxwell swivels and pulls it very fine, there was a man at deep backward square leg but he could only watch the ball sail over the boundary]]></line><line><![CDATA[31.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, <b>FOUR</b>, he'll smash you if you give him width. Shortish and wide outside off stump, Maxwell smashes it over extra-cover, it came off the bottom of the bat, but he hit it well enough]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Australian dressing room looks very relaxed now.]]></line><line><![CDATA[31.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, on-driven straight to mid-on this time. A couple of yards either side of the fielder would have been runs]]></line><line><![CDATA[31.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, fullish and on the off stump, Maxwell defends it back to the bowler, who fumbles the ball to his right but they don't take the run]]></line><line><![CDATA[31.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, drives very well but straight to cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[31.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Watson, 1 run, slower ball full toss, looked like Watson was surprised by the lack of the pace on it, but he managed to tap it wide of mid-on. That brings up his <b>33rd ODI fifty</b>. Credit to him for hanging around despite that brilliant spell from Wahab Riaz]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[30.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, 2 runs, wow! A crunchy drive on the rise from Maxwell after playing a few rash shots. He looks so good when he times them sweetly and this time he sends it through extra-cover for a couple of runs]]></line><line><![CDATA[30.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, <b>wide</b>, oops! Sprays this down the leg-side, Maxwell gets inside the line and tries to help it on its way but misses it completely]]></line><line><![CDATA[30.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, no run, Riaz bowls a pacy short ball and also follows Maxwell as he makes room, the batsman throws the kitchen sink at it but misses]]></line><line><![CDATA[30.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, 1 run, poor fielding from Ahmed Shehzad. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Watson steers it straight to backward point, who fumbles and allows the run]]></line><line><![CDATA[30.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run, short ball down the leg-side, Maxwell tries to pull but gets it on the glove and it rolls to fine leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[30.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, <b>FOUR</b>, oh my word! What sort of a shot is that? This is unfair for the bowler. He's actually outthought the batsman but it's four runs against his name. Maxwell backs away early, Riaz follows him with a short ball, Maxwell was cramped for room on the pull, the ball hit the bottom of the blade and raced away past backward point]]></line><line><![CDATA[30.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, <b>FOUR</b>, looks like Australia have it under control now! Riaz looks for the inswinging fuller length delivery, Maxwell waits for the ball and flicks it along the ground through mid-wicket]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[29.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Watson, <b>FOUR</b>, nicely driven and there is no one sweeping on the off-side. Good length delivery outside off stump, Watson bends his knees a bit to get under the ball, just creams the drive through cover and it races away. Fifth boundary for Watson and he's approaching a fifty]]></line><line><![CDATA[29.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, 1 run, Maxwell drives with an angled bat again, he plays on the rise as well, but Umar Akmal moves to his right and takes some pace off the ball]]></line><line><![CDATA[29.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, <b>FOUR</b>, pulls in the air and it's over the infield. Shortish ball from Ehsan Adil, Maxwell plays this over mid-wicket and picks up four]]></line><line><![CDATA[29.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, good length delivery outside off stump, Maxwell drives and picks out cover again]]></line><line><![CDATA[29.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, outside off stump, punched towards cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[29.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, steeply rising short of length delivery outside off stump, Maxwell cuts and misses]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Ehsan Adil [3.0-0-11-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[However, at the other end, Steven Smith played with composure. He seems to have more time on his hands. Smith washed away the challenge of facing up to a fine pace attack with aplomb and composed a crucial fifty. Ehsan Adil then dismissed Smith to give Pakistan a glimmer of hope of coming back into the game. However, Sohail Khan dropped a catch as well to give Glenn Maxwell a reprieve. Riaz was again the unlucky bowler.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Wahab Riaz continued to test Shane Watson with vicious bouncers. The strategy almost worked as Watson took his eyes off the ball while looking to pull Riaz, but Rahat Ali dropped a sitter at long leg. It wasn't just about Riaz bowling at scorching pace, but he bowled it head high and outside the off-stump, when he dug it short. The left-armer's angle also troubled Watson.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Drinks</b> are on the field now]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run, back of a length and on the stumps, Maxwell presents the full face of the bat and pushes it in front of mid-on for a quick single]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, 1 run, length ball and on Watson's pads, nudged away behind square on the on-side for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run, back of a length and just outside off, eased wide of cover for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, <b>wide</b>, another short ball from Riaz, this one's gone down leg-side as well, called as a wide]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, no run, the bumper from Riaz, Maxwell ducks under it and lets it go]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Maxwell, 2 runs, <b>another drop and Riaz has his hands on his head</b>, a nothing shot from Maxwell, this was banged in short and on the stumps, Maxwell made room for the swat, got into a horrible position on the shot, it wasn't a pull, it wasn't a cross batted swipe, it wasn't a cut either, the ball loops over backward point. Sohail Khan gets across from the deep, gets his fingertips on that and can't hold on. Another costly miss for Pakistan]]></line><line><![CDATA[28.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Watson, 1 run, back of a length and just outside off, punched wide of cover-point for a single]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Wahab Riaz [6.0-0-24-2] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Riaz is back for perhaps <b>one last fling</b>.

It is also the 15th wicket for Riaz in this World Cup. <b>Warner c Rahat Ali b Riaz 24(23) [4s-3]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Riaz to Warner, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Warner pulls away as there was someone chatting as Riaz sprinted into bowl]]></line><line><![CDATA[8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Warner, <b>wide</b>, short and down leg, Warner takes it on, doesn't make contact, wide called for line]]></line><line><![CDATA[8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to S Smith, 1 run, easily done, shuffles across and nurdles the short of length delivery to deep backward square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riaz to Warner, 3 runs, shortish and outside off, Warner cuts it in front of square, Shehzad and Afridi give chase, the former dives full length and hauls it back for the latter.

I think the boys bowled well throughout the whole 50 overs. So, I think we are pretty happy with the total. The wicket is pretty good. It swung a little bit early, all in all, it's pretty good. It is great to be back in. We have quality depth in our squad of fast bowling. So, whenever you have a chance, you have to try and impress. I think so. Hopefully, we will get off to a good start. Just a matter of getting through the runs and off to a good start and hopefully chase them down."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Pakistan have a fine bowling line-up and under lights, it may not be easy to bat. The lowest winning ODI total at this ground is 140, when Wasim Raja bowled an inspired spell to help Pakistan skittle out the West Indies for just 132, but that game took place back in 1981. In short, Australia should fancy their chances of chasing down this paltry target to reach the semi-finals. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Among the bowlers, Starc bowled with great rhythm. He swung the new ball and with the old ball, bowled from around the wicket to generate reverse swing. With subtle changes of wrist and fingers, he is causing all sorts of problems to opposition ranks in this World Cup. He is bowling with a good burst of pace too. Starc's partner in crime with the new ball, Hazlewood, bowled parsimoniously and took four wickets. With Maxwell taking a couple of key scalps as well, Australia gained the upper hand. On expected lines, their fielding was top notch.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[It was the impressive Mitchell Starc, who made the initial breakthrough by snaffling Sarfraz Ahmed's wicket. Sarfraz's tendency to guide it through the slip cordon cost his wicket. The metronomic Josh Hazlewood, known for his unrelenting control and untiring stamina, then struck by sending Ahmed Shehzad back to the pavilion. For the umpteenth time in his career, Misbah-ul-Haq had to lead from the front. He bided his time before clouting Glenn Maxwell for a couple of sixes. However, in an attempt to up the scoring rate, he perished and was dismissed by Maxwell. Haris Sohail had his fair share of luck, before he threw his wicket away. Pakistan found themselves in more trouble, when Umar Akmal too gifted his wicket away. Shahid Afridi slashed and bashed his way to play a cameo, but today was the day he needed to crack a half-century.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The well-oiled Australian bowling unit landed crucial blows at regular intervals to bundle out the opposition for a modest total. In fact, it could be said that the poor shot selection by most of Pakistan's batsmen also played a part in them losing the plot. The pacers generally bowled with good control to join the dots and frustrate the batsmen. The strategy worked superbly for them. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[49.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faulkner to Ehsan Adil, <b>out</b> Caught by Starc!! All over.

They've left a little bit of grass on it, so I think we will see some good pace and carry and hopefully a little bit of seam with the new ball."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Misbah</b>: "I believe it's all about momentum and we've got the right momentum at the moment. Winning four games in a row, I think everybody is confident. That's the ideal type of situation we need to have before the knockout stage. We are going to <b>bat</b> first. Looks like there is a bit more pace and bounce and it might assist the seamers. This (pitch) looks a little bit different from the last two pitches. Let's see. We've been bowling in the night. So even movement with the new ball, seam movement and little bit of more carry and bounce has really helped. I am not sure about reverse swing today bowling in the night, but I think we will get little bit of conventional swing. We are going in with the same side that played against Ireland."]]></line><line><![CDATA[It's <b>toss time</b>!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pitch report</b> by Damien Fleming: The sun is out. The pitch looks an absolute belter. Nice and hard and flat. If the opening bowlers pitch the ball up, they should get some traditional swing. With a well-grassed pitch, it won't deteriorate much for reverse swing to come into play in the last 10 overs. India scored 300, Bangladesh 275, if you get in, pace and bounce will be consistent, so you should be able to score around that 275-300 mark.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Tom Moody</b> has the latest Australian team news.

In a knockout game, it wouldn't be wise to write them off, even though Australia are firm favorites. It takes only one bad day to go out of the tournament at this stage and Pakistan will certainly be preying on that stat.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Four wins on the bounce has given Pakistan momentum. The batting was the weak link especially at the top of the order and they rectified that by including Sarfraz from the South Africa game. That decision proved to be a fine choice as the diminutive keeper batsman injected life into a dull batting line-up. Younis Khan hasn't made runs though and so has Sohaib Maqsood. More is expected from Umar Akmal too. Misbah remains the only consistent performer with the bat. That should worry Pakistan a bit. But the quickies have responded magnificently although Mohammad Irfan would be a big loss.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pakistan:</b> Their campaign started off pretty much like the 1992 tournament. Losses to India and West Indies left them in danger of not even reaching the quarter-finals. There was some stinging criticism from ex-players directed at Misbah after those two losses. The pressure was on Pakistan and how well they have responded. A close win against Zimbabwe, which was a gritty performance set them back on track. A big win over UAE followed. But it was the game against South Africa that Pakistan really came alive. On a spicy Eden Park wicket, Pakistan were inspired with the ball as the four seamers sent South Africa hurtling to defeat, despite not having a huge score to defend. Coming into their last game against Ireland, Pakistan needed a win to progress. A defeat would've ended their hopes there. Sarfraz came to the party with a hundred as Pakistan booked a quarter-final date with Australia.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Aussies look the most complete outfit amongst all the teams in the tournament. Warner, Finch, Smith, Clarke and Maxwell all have made runs with the bat. Their batting carries a destructive look with Starc at 10. They have tinkered with the bowling attack still unsure of what their best bowling line-up is. Starc has undoubtedly been the leader of the pack and is the bowler of the tournament. His swinging yorkers at the death have proved to be unhittable and he is the one to watch out for. Johnson has been disappointing and has leaked runs. But with Starc in such form, Australia are afforded the luxury of a few expensive bowlers.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Road to the quarter-final</b>: Australia have had a smooth passage into the quarters winning four out of their six games. They smashed England in the opener and then proceeded to win against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Scotland. All four were convincing wins with Australia posting huge totals on the board. Their game against Bangladesh was washed out while they suffered a one-wicket loss to New Zealand in one of the most thrilling games of this tournament. Mitchell Starc nearly produced a miracle at Eden Park in a crazy game, but Kane Williamson's monk like exterior thwarted the Aussies.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It was Pakistan's greatest night and one that they will never forget. Wondering why so much focus on Pakistan's World Cup win in 1992. Because it came in Australia. And there are so many similarities to that 1992 campaign. What about Australia you may ask? Well we are getting there exactly. Moving on, let us dwell on how Australia have done so far in this World Cup.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Imran described the win as his greatest ever achievement. "I rate the moments after the World Cup victory as the most pleasing and satisfying of my career as I had never seen the people of Pakistan so happy," the International Cricket Council quoted him as saying. Imran's win had a philanthropic side attached to it as well as he used the funds generated from the win to realise his lifelong ambition of building a cancer hospital in memory of his late mother. The dream came true as the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center, opened in Lahore on December 29, 1994.]]></line><line><![CDATA["The team were in awe of Imran," said Fazal, "We just looked at each other and said Imran 'must be a sorcerer or something'."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Later, after the victory, Imran said: "I told you we would win."]]></line><line><![CDATA[So how did Wasim Akram feel after winning the biggest prize? "It sunk in that we won the World Cup only two or three days later. First of all, we couldn't sleep that night. I remember I had to share half a sleeping pill with Ijaz (Ahmed) to go to bed because we couldn't sleep till three or four in the morning."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Imran Khan was one man who believed that his side could win even when his team-mates thought otherwise. Imran would say, at every team meeting: "We will win before we leave." The 12th man on that day at the MCG, <b>Zahid Fazal</b>, recalled how Imran kept believing despite an embarrassing performance against England in the league game. "After we were bowled out for 74, we packed our bags [because we thought we were finished]. But Imran insisted we would still win the World Cup."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Imran had done it. Pakistan had done it. It was an epochal night for Pakistan, in front of a then-record crowd of 87,182 at the MCG. Imran had inspired his side to World Cup glory. At the age of 39. On his last legs. At the last attempt. After coming back from retirement. No-one could've written a script like that too. It was destined to end this way. Not in despair like in 1987. Sport did give him a fairytale ending. Destiny played its part too. The stars aligned themselves perfectly to make this possible. A champion had ended his career a World Cup winner. The World Cup sat comfortably in his arms. The circle was complete. The dream realised. The journey done. <b>Imran Khan - World Cup winner. Pakistan - World Champions.</b> Imran wanted to see this. He did.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Ian Botham who was dismissed by Wasim Akram in the final felt that the left-arm seamer was the real deal. "The one player who really stood out for me was Wasim Akram. It was in that tournament that we realised just what a special talent he was and how much trouble he was going to give us and the rest of the world in the years to come. What a player he was."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Here is another example of Imran's man-management skills. Wasim Akram had a huge problem with no-balls and wides during the 1992 World Cup. He was bowling with the white Kookaburra and found himself unable to control his swing. Also he repeatedly overstepped striving for more pace. Imran though trusted his ace and said this to the local newspapers: "I don't mind Wasim bowling no-balls as long as he bowls quick". Wasim repaid his captain's trust with a Man of the Match performance.]]></line><line><![CDATA[So what did Imran have in mind for the final? Any new surprise? Yes there was one. He sported a t-shirt with a tiger's picture on it at the toss. Many were stunned and curious to know why he had done so. "If the boys play like tigers then I don't mind if they win or lose," he famously remarked. Before the final, he had asked his team to play like "Cornered Tigers". They did just that beating England by 22 runs with Imran fittingly taking the final wicket. Imran had promoted himself to three to protect the middle-order and his move proved to be a masterstroke. Along with Javed Miandad, he added 139 runs for the third wicket in 31 overs. Imran made 72 - which took Pakistan to 249. It was a huge decision to take, but Imran trusted himself so much. When he was not in form! Another of Imran's proteges, Wasim Akram lit up the MCG with a stunning display with ball in hand. Wasim had earlier made a cameo 18-ball 33 with the bat and was confidence personified with the ball.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The semi-final win was one more example of Imran backing his players. Now onto the final. First time ever Pakistan had reached the World Cup final after three failed semi-final results. The greatest night of Imran's career. Or would it end in tears? The venue - MCG with more than 1 lakh expected for the final. Against England who were favoured to win. England were playing some sublime cricket led from the front by another of Imran's great rivals, Ian Botham. Imran had lived all his life for this occasion and he deserved to be there.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Miandad was impressed. Pakistan had gone through to the final and Imran's decision to keep faith in Inzamam was a masterstroke. Rameez Raja who played in that game and made 44 opening the batting was full of praise for Inzy's batting. "The spark was provided by Inzi, who played the innings of a lifetime, and Javed was the calming partner in that match-winning partnership." Ken Rutherford was awestruck by the impact that Inzamam had on the game. "A lot's been said about the tactics in the field, but I don't go along with that. No one could have foreseen the impact Inzamam would have."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Still a lot had to be done to beat New Zealand who had made 262 on a slow surface at the Eden Park in Auckland. Pakistan needed 123 runs in 90 balls when Inzy strode out. His batting form had been poor till then and even Javed Miandad thought he didn't deserve a spot in the team. The critics were out to get him if he failed. Then Inzamam showed his class and maturity as he played one of the all-time great match-turning innings in a high pressure situation. His 37-ball 60 took Pakistan over the winning line. Ironically it was Javed who was with him at the other end as he smashed the Kiwi bowlers all around Eden Park.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Legend has it that Inzamam pleaded with Imran to drop him from the team for the semi-final as he had taken ill, but Imran stood firm. Inzy had taken sleeping pills to calm himself before the big semi-final and that move backfired on him. According to ICC-Cricket - "A sleepless night with regular visits to the washroom left him ill and he announced himself unfit on the morning of the match. But Imran, first by himself and then through Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed, convinced Inzamam to take the field and bat even if he had to do it in a "wheelchair"."]]></line><line><![CDATA[But Pakistan won all three and booked a spot in the semis. There they took on New Zealand and the inspirational leadership of Imran came to the fore again. Young Inzamam was a special talent. Imran knew it. And he believed in him. Inzamam had just 123 runs in eight league games but Imran still believed in him. Any other captain would've dropped a player for such a poor run. But Imran wasn't any other captain. He had the knack of spotting talent and backing them to the hilt. Imran could've taken the easy route and played another batsman in Inzy's spot. He didn't.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Pakistan's 1992 campaign got off to a miserable start when they were thumped by West Indies, who won by 10 wickets. Then at Adelaide, they were bowled out for 74 and looked set for a thrashing. But rain came to their rescue and gave them a point - which eventually proved vital as that point took them to the semis. A deflating loss to India was followed by another loss to South Africa. Pakistan's points table showed - played 5, won 1, lost 3, NR 1. There were three more games remaining and all were must-win. It wasn't easy clashes as well. Against Australia, Sri Lanka and high-flying New Zealand.]]></line><line><![CDATA[So on that note, we welcome everyone to our live coverage of this big quarter-final between Australia and Pakistan being played at the Adelaide Oval. It is time to reminisce and refresh our memories a little bit as we have plenty of time for the game to begin. So let's continue our build-up for the game by focussing on Pakistan's greatest moment. We have started with Imran and it would only be apt to focus on what happened after 1987. So sit back and enjoy all that we bring you.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Fast forward to the 1992 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand. Imran was 39 at that time and clearly looked half the player he was. He had lost all his pace and just was a medium-pace trundler in the Mudassar Nazar and Mohinder Amarnath mould. He was a liability in the field. But he could still bat and more importantly, captain and lead his men. He could inspire his troops. That is why he opted for one final hurrah. So will the dream finally come true? Or was it just a bad move to bring Imran back?]]></line><line><![CDATA[So how would Imran be remembered? As one of Pakistan's greatest cricketers and captains ever or will he be judged based on his failure to win a World Cup for his country? A World Cup winning medal around the neck is what completes a cricketer's career. Imran knew that. Due to popular demand and with a burning desire to give it one more shot, he reversed his retirement decision and decided to come back again. Credit to the then President of Pakistan, Zia-ul-Haq who requested Imran to come back and lead the team again.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Everyone were anticipating and expecting an India-Pakistan final at the iconic Eden Gardens. Why? Because India were playing England in the other semi-final and the dream final was India-Pakistan. It was not to be. Eventually it turned out to be an Australia-England final. So one of cricket's greatest all-rounders and most charismatic captains ever, Imran Khan had to finish like this. His great rival and friend from across the border, Kapil Dev had led India to glory in 1983. Imran had failed to do so. It must have hurt. Really hurt. They say there are no fairytale endings in sport. This seemed to cater to that logic.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>12:00 Local Time, 01:30 GMT, 07:00 IST:</b> A nation's dreams dashed! A dashing general's last hurrah. The end of an era. The charismatic captain and leader of men - Imran Khan would bow out of the world stage in front of his adoring countrymen. The script wasn't written like this. It wasn't destined to end this way. But on 4th November, 1987, at a packed Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, in a World Cup semi-final, Imran Khan stood a defeated man. His side had been firm favorites going up against Australia, but Pakistan choked when it mattered the most and lost. That Pakistan side had Rameez Raja, Saleem Malik, Imran himself, Javed Miandad, a young Wasim Akram, and Abdul Qadir, along with a few upcoming stars. The favorites tag had placed too much pressure and they crumbled.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b> by <b>G Rajaraman</b><br/>Australia will start favourite to win their ICC Cricket World Cup quarterfinal against Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval on Friday not only because they have the team with the better all-round strength but also because there is a hint of fragility about the batting unit in Misbah-ul-Haq's team. Curiously, Australia captain Michael Clarke expects a wonderful, entertaining game.<br/><br/>Yet, Australia captain Michael Clarke, thought to be beleaguered at the start of the World Cup because of his runs-in with selectors and Cricket Australia officials but seeming to be well in control of the leadership, said his team will have to play their best cricket on Friday to beat Pakistan. "I don't think you're ever owed anything in this game of cricket," he said.<br/><br/>"It's been a long tournament. It's been a really good tournament for the game of cricket. I think everybody's at a stage now where it's been building and building and everybody's really excited that we're finally here. Your No. 1 goal is to make it to the quarterfinals. When you get here, you look forward to that big stage and playing against the best," Clarke said.<br/><br/>"I think Pakistan have been underrated for a long time, especially in the shorter form of the game. I think they've got a lot of talent. I think they're attack is very good and they've shown that throughout this series. I think they've got a good mix of youth and experience and their batting really well, and they're led well from Misbah," Clarke said.<br/><br/>With a batting unit that includes explosive openers David Warner and Aaron Finch, the incredibly talented Steve Smith, Clarke himself and allrounders Shane Watson and Glenn Maxwell, Australia can be expected to handle the challenge of the Pakistan pace bowlers, led by Wahab Riaz, who has surprised out many batsmen with his pace and skiddy bounce.<br/><br/>Even though left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson has not been their spearhead – ceding that spot to the deadly Mitchell Starc – Australia have the attack to keep the Pakistan batsmen in check. Sarfraz Ahmed has infused vim and vigour in the Pakistan batting but, as skipper Misbah-ul-Haq pointed out, it is important for them to not lose too many wickets at the start.<br/><br/>Misbah also said his team believed in itself, drawing strength from the fact that favourites do not always have to win games. "The team that performs better on a day, has better chances, better luck, can really defeat any team. We are hopeful and very positive. I think we've got a bowling line-up which can really go through any team, and a few batters just getting back into form. This is only a matter of just putting a good show on that day," he said.<br/><br/>Yet, viewed dispassionately, Australia will have to contribute to their own downfall but by the looks of it, Clarke's team is not ready to drop its intensity yet.
