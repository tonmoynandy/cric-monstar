			<line><![CDATA[That's all we have for you from day 1 of the one-off Test between these two Asian nations. Tomorrow, Dhawan and Vijay will look to better their previous best opening partnership of 289 against Australia, but <b>can they go past the world record of 415, made by Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie?</b> Join us tomorrow to find out, but don't forget <b>play will start 30 minutes early tomorrow</b>.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Vijay then survived a close LBW shout at the fag end of the day, only to be saved by an inside edge. Dhawan marched on and reached 150 just before the umpires decided to call stumps because of the fading light. Bangladesh tried seven bowlers during the course of the day but none of them were able to achieve a breakthrough. Although the odd one is turning and bouncing, the pitch is absolutely flat and the batsmen would enjoy batting on this surface on Day 2.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It rained, rained and rained and after almost four hours, play resumed with about 38 overs remaining in the day. The story was no different for Bangladesh even after the break as both the Indian openers batted freely. Vijay upped the ante and recorded his 11th Test fifty and Dhawan soon brought up his third Test match hundred. It was the first hundred for the left-handed batsman in 15 innings.  The duo stretched their partnership past 200 and in the process recorded India's highest ever opening stand against Bangladesh in Tests.]]></line><line><![CDATA[239/0 in 56 overs after opting to bat first, India will take that with both hands. The fact that they scored at 4.27 runs per over explains their dominance. The pitch had hardly anything in it for the bowlers and both Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay were able to score at will. The latter though survived a very close LBW shout in the second over of the day even before opening his account. However, as the morning progressed, the duo were able to find the gaps and Dhawan in particular, was severe on the bowlers. He raced to fifty off 47 balls, but had a nervy moment soon after as Shuvagata Hom dropped him just before the skies opened up.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The umpires have decided that the current light is not sufficient for play to continue and it's <b>stumps on day 1</b>. Dhawan and Vijay walk off after punching gloves with each other. A few Bangladeshi players walk up to Dhawan and congratulate him for his achievement.]]></line><line><![CDATA[55.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, 1 run, <b>Dhawan gets to 150 with this single</b>, this was a flighted delivery outside off, Dhawan comes down the track and drives it towards mid-off, sets off for a single and makes it comfortably]]></line><line><![CDATA[55.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, 2 runs, Dhawan comes down the track, doesn't get to the pitch of the ball but goes through with the flick, the ball goes uppishly through mid-wicket, the fielder in the deep runs to his left, puts in the dive and saves a couple for his team]]></line><line><![CDATA[55.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Vijay, 1 run, quicker and on middle and leg stump line, Vijay goes deep in the crease and nudges it behind square on the leg-side for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[55.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Vijay, no run, flighted delivery around off, Vijay leans forward and defends]]></line><line><![CDATA[55.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Vijay, no run, flatter and turning away on off, Vijay goes on the back foot and blocks]]></line><line><![CDATA[55.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Vijay, no run, darted full and on off, Vijay defends with his bat close to the pad]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[54.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Vijay, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, Vijay waits inside the crease, opens the face of the bat and pushes it square of the wicket for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[54.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Vijay, no run, bowls this in the channel outside off, Vijay gets behind the line and blocks it to cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[54.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Vijay, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, the ball keeps slightly low as Vijay mistimes the punch to silly mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[54.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Vijay, no run, bowls this on a length and outside off, Vijay comes forward and defends it to cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[54.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Vijay, no run, bowls this slightly wide outside off, Vijay punches it to the right of gully, can't get the single away]]></line><line><![CDATA[54.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Vijay, no run, length ball outside off, Vijay opens the face of the bat and guides it to the left of gully, who gets across and stops the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[53.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Vijay, 1 run, flatter from Islam, Vijay rocks back and knocks it to sweeper cover, he will keep the strike]]></line><line><![CDATA[53.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, 1 run, advances and works this flighted delivery through mid-wicket to get off strike]]></line><line><![CDATA[53.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, no run, comes down the track and defends this slowish delivery to silly mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[53.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, no run, <b>almost a catch!</b> This was tossed up by Islam, Dhawan comes forward and drives it in the air towards silly mid-on, who dives but the ball bounces right in front of him]]></line><line><![CDATA[53.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, no run, flighted delivery on the stumps, Dhawan takes a step forward and drives it to silly mid-on, who misfields but luckily for him, the batsmen don't take the single]]></line><line><![CDATA[53.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Dhawan, no run, floated up outside off, Dhawan comes down the track and drives it to the right of the bowler, who dives and stops the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Some tape is being applied to the edges of Vijay's bat.

Their captain, Virat Kohli, called the right side of the coin and had no hesitation in opting to bat first on a flat wicket. Openers Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay played cautiously at the start, before the former upped the ante after getting his eye in. Vijay though got a reprieve early in the innings as he survived a close lbw call on 0 off Soumya Sarkar. The Bangladeshi bowlers, however, could not stem the run flow and soon lost the plot as they bowled freebies.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>11:52 Local Time, 05:52 GMT, 11:22 IST:</b> As expected, <b>lunch</b> has been taken early as it continues to rain.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>11:46 Local Time, 05:46 GMT, 11:16 IST:</b> The news is that the rain is quite heavy at the moment in Fatullah.

Rohit Sharma batted at three during the SCG Test and will continue to hold that position. A comeback for Harbhajan Singh as well, he will feature in his first Test since playing against Australia at home in 2013. Varun Aaron is back as well. He replaces Bhuvneshwar Kumar. A debutant for Bangladesh. Litton Das becomes the 77th player to wear the national cap.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b> (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(c), Shakib Al Hasan, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das(w), Shuvagata Hom, Jubair Hossain, Taijul Islam, Mohammad Shahid]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>India</b> (Playing XI): Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli(c), Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Rahim:</b> 'Looks like a flat track, but as the Test progresses, it will become slower. Unlucky to lose the toss, but we need to restrict them to a modest score. We are playing three spinners plus Shakib. We played well against Pakistan, the boys are very confident. We are looking forward to a good Test.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Kohli:</b> 'We will bat first, looks like a pretty nice and hard wicket. It's the beginning of the full-time job, pretty excited, hopefully, we can put up a strong performance. I never thought I will be India's Test captain at 26. God has been kind, I have worked hard, at the end of the day, I have the opportunity to do something special for the team. I think a lot about the game, I like to find new ideas. It's very exciting to get into the psyche of the batsmen. We are playing six batsmen, three seamers and two spinners. <b>Dhawan</b> replaces <b>KL Rahul</b>. We have <b>Ashwin</b> and <b>Harbhajan</b> as well.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>India have won the toss and have opted to bat</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Time for the <b>toss</b>..]]></line><line><![CDATA[There's a concern about the wicket-keeper for Bangladesh as well. Will Rahim keep? If he doesn't, Litton Das will make his Test debut and will play as the keeper.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Early Team news:</b> There will be at least one change to the Indian team that last featured in a Test match, at SCG, against Australia. Illness prevented opener, KL Rahul, from travelling and he will be replaced by Shikhar Dhawan. Ravichandran Ashwin is a sure starter. But will India go in with three spinners? If so, then both Harbhajan Singh and Karn Sharma will feature in the playing XI, else one will miss out. Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav are likely to open with the new-ball. Kohli said he is a big fan of playing five bowlers.  That will mean only one of Cheteshwar Pujara or Rohit Sharma will feature in the playing eleven.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Skipper, Mushfiqur Rahim, has oozed confidence and believes his team has it in them to upstage the more famed neighbours. "For me, playing against India gives me extra motivation as the entire cricketing world will be watching the series with a lot of interest. When we beat Pakistan in the ODI series, critics said that it was not a quality team. So there is extra bit of motivation for me to do well against India," he said.]]></line><line><![CDATA[But it's not just India who will be playing today. Hosts, Bangladesh, have things to prove as well. While they have lifted their game in the shorter forms of the game, they have remained slack in the longer format of the game. They have the goods, they have upped their game in recent times. The comeback from behind to draw against Pakistan remains fresh in memory. The young batsmen have finally learnt the art of batting in Tests. But can they take 20 wickets? That's one area that remains a concern for this Bangladeshi line-up.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Come June 2015, Kohli will begin a new era. He's now firmly in the hot seat. There will be no MS Dhoni to guide him on his way. Thankfully for him, India will not be travelling overseas anytime soon. One can say it's a soft start as well. With all respect, Bangladesh haven't proved to be as intimidating in Tests as they have been in the shorter formats of the game. Kohli isn't taking things easy though. This is what he said just before India left for the tour. "We are looking for a fresh start. I'm looking forward to plan what will hopefully be a good 3-4 years," he said. Can he motivate his troops and make India a top Test team once again?]]></line><line><![CDATA[Virat Kohli was formally anointed as India's Test captain at the start of 2015. He didn't compromise his aggression, but at the same time, showed that he could adapt to the modern challenges. When Dhoni missed out in the first Test at Adelaide, Kohli walked the talk. He batted in a supreme fashion - making hundreds in both innings. India promised that they would go for the target. At tea on the final day, they were well within reach, only for the familiar Indian batting collapse to undo all the good work. When he was back as captain, for the Sydney Test, he wasn't going to make the same mistake once again. India battled hard and saved the Test. They had lost the series, but the promise of a better future was written all over.]]></line><line><![CDATA[This young and brash India was led by a captain who had seen it and experienced it all in the shorter forms of the game. However, MS Dhoni, the Test captain couldn't match MS Dhoni - the ODI skipper. He led from the front, but at times, India seemed to lack that killer punch, the aggression that made teams like Australia and South Africa - world beaters in the Test format. It is to his credit that Dhoni steered the ship, allowed the youngsters to get a feel of what Test cricket was all about before announcing his retirement and passing the baton to Virat Kohli - his long time successor, at the end of the Australian tour.]]></line><line><![CDATA[India begin their long journey towards Test revival with tiny steps. First up in a long and hectic international calendar will see them playing Bangladesh in a short series comprising of one Test and three ODIs. An inexperienced team India fought hard in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia. The fab four were replaced by a new generation of cricketers. They were mainly fed on the T20 diet, but they showed that they can play the longer form of the game with equal ease as well.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview:</b><br/>A lot has changed since India and Bangladesh last played a Test match. Virender Sehwag, who famously remarked that Bangladesh didn't have the bowling to take 20 wickets, isn't around. Nor are the other members of the then fabled Indian middle-order. India aren't the top-ranked Test side anymore and could slip down to seventh if they lose while Bangladesh have won more Test matches in the last five years than they did before 2010. However, the hosts' proclivity to take those 20 wickets remain questionable.<br/><br/>After 18 months of playing only overseas Tests, India return to red-ball cricket in the familiar surroundings of the sub-continent. Virat Kohli starts his first full international season as Test captain with a one-off match against Bangladesh. Despite unfavourable results in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia and the subsequent slide in the rankings, the young Indian side showed a lot of pedigree. A win against Bangladesh should help reinforce their belief and hold them in good stead for the sterner tests to follow.<br/><br/>Bangladesh cricket is going through its renaissance. Their run to the quarter-finals of the World Cup was followed by a thrashing of Pakistan in the limited overs series. However, despite running their opponents close on many occasions, Bangladesh remain a work-in-progress in the longer format. A one-off Test gives them another opportunity to assess their standing.<br/><br/><b>Start Date:</b> 10th June 2015<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Khan Saheb Osman Ali Stadium, Fatullah<br/><br/><b>Start time:</b> 09:30 IST, 04:00 GMT<br/><br/><b>Weather:</b> Hot and Humid with a high of 36 degree Celsius and a 10% chance of showers.<br/><br/><b>Team News:</b><br/><br/><b>Bangladesh:</b><br/><br/>Bangladesh have selection issues ahead of the Test exacerbated by injury to senior batsman Mohammad Mahmudullah. Nasir Hossain, who last played in the series against West Indies in September 2014, could replace him in the eleven and double up as an off-spinner. There are also concerns over captain Mushfiqur Rahim's workload after he sustained a finger injury during the Pakistan Tests and is likely to handover keeping duties to Litton Das. Speedster Rubel Hossain's return to fitness, however, would relieve the Bangladesh supporters especially in the aftermath of Shahdat Hossain's long-term injury.<br/><br/>Probable XI: Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (c), Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das (wk) Shuvagata Hom, Taijul Islam, Mohammad Shahid, Rubel Hossain<br/><br/><b>India:</b><br/><br/>India will return to the opening pair of Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay following KL Rahul's late withdrawal due to illness. With a mixed county cricket experience behind him, Cheteshwar Pujara should return to the playing eleven after facing the axe in the New Year's Test in Sydney. It remains to be seen, however, if he will return to his usual position at No. 3 or swap places with Rohit Sharma. The returning Harbhajan Singh is likely to partner fellow off-spinner R Ashwin to counter the left-handers in the Bangladeshi ranks while the think-tank will weigh up Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav for the second pacer's slot.<br/><br/>Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (c), Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav/Bhuvneshwar Kumar<br/><br/><b>Stats and Trivia:</b><br/><br/>- Shakib Al Hasan needs five runs and a wicket to complete 2000 runs and 100 wickets in Bangladesh<br/><br/>- Mominul Haque stands a chance to equal AB de Villiers' record of having scored the most number of fifties in consecutive Tests (12).<br/><br/><b>Quotes:</b><br/><br/><i>"We have learnt in the past few Test matches but starting now, we want to start achieving the results we really want, not to go away from every Test match thinking we have learnt from it"</i><br/><br/>- India captain <b>Virat Kohli</b> lays down the marker when asked about his team's goals.<br/><br/><i>"I am nowhere near him, you know he is the king of all forms of cricket"</i><br/><br/>- An embarrassed <b>Mominul Haque</b> on comparisons with AB de Villiers.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b> (From): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(c), Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Das(w), Soumya Sarkar, Shuvagata Hom, Taijul Islam, Jubair Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Nasir Hossain, Mohammad Shahid, Abul Hasan]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>India</b> (From): Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli(c), Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Karn Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Varun Aaron]]></line>
