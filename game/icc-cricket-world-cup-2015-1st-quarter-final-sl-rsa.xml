Congratulations !!!]]></line><line><![CDATA["They (spinners) came in at a really crucial stage. I decided to extend the spells of the seamers up front today. We bowled seam till the 14th-15th over. Most teams introduce spin before that. Especially a team that doesn't have the 5th bowler option as a frontline bowler. Always knew JP (Duminy) was going to have to bowl probably 10 overs. For the two of them (Duminy and Tahir) to come up against a sub-continent team and at a crucial stage of the game and to perform like they did, gives a lot of confidence to our spin bowling attack going into the rest of the games. I am quietly confident (of winning the cup). I am always a positive kind of guy. I like to believe in big things. I truly believe we are going to go all the way. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. But we know there is a long way to go. I spoke to Morne (Morkel) now, who loves fishing and I said it's almost like we've got the fish on the hook now. Now the hard work starts, you've got to reel it in and do all the hard work. Two massive games hopefully coming for us. But for now, just go and enjoy a beer and think of what is to come and that's the semi-finals."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>de Villiers</b>: "I didn't have to do too much. The guys were honestly very motivated for this game. I am just very proud of what the guys achieved today. You always never know what to expect in the knockout stages. It's difficult games, difficult situations. But, we just had a good feeling coming into the ground today and the guys were really in a good space. We really rocked up mentally here today, wanting to win this game. We were almost obsessed with our goal and really went after it. I was going to bat first and I would have backed the batters to have done a good job today. But looking back at the game now, pretty happy that we bowled first. The way the guys set the trend up front - Dale (Steyn), Abbo (Kyle Abbott) and Morne (Morkel) - just incredible and the rest of the guys followed. He (Quinton de Kock) has been going through a tough time. We all know as sports people and cricketers that we go through patches in our careers. A lot of credit has to go to the selectors and the coach and the rest of guys who kept backing him. For him to come off like that today, with a couple of crucial catches and an amazing knock at the end with a really tricky total against a good bowling line-up, was amazing. So it's good to have Quinny (de Kock) back and I am looking forward to the next few games with him up the order. He told me the ball before (when asked if they knew about Duminy's hat-trick), listen I am on a hat-trick. Are you maybe going to give me another catcher? So I went to silly-point and just the two of us knew it. I spread the message as soon he got the wicket that, you know it was a hat-trick and the guys were like, no it's not. The guys got pretty excited when they realised that it was a hat-trick."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Mathews</b>: "Don't know to be honest. I thought 130 was not too much on this track. There were no demons on the track, we could have batted well. We could have at least got to 250 and given our bowlers a chance, but unfortunately we didn't bat well. Maybe the nerves. We just didn't go for the shots maybe. This is easily the worst performance that we've done in the World Cup and it happened to be in the quarter-finals. We all know that South Africans have a really good bowling attack, but it's just that we didn't bat well from ball one. We were not there. I thought we were a bit nervous, but unfortunately, that's the way it goes. It's disappointing not to make it a memorable one for Mahela and Sanga. But let me take this opportunity on behalf of the country and the team to thank them for their services. They have rendered their services for more than 16-17 years and it's invaluable service. So we really salute them and we thank them. The best thing would have been to go to the final and win it for them, but unfortunately we couldn't do it and we'll find a way to try and make them smile. It's even (when asked who he thought would win the cup). Anything can happen in the knockout stages. All the quarter-finals teams are capable, so I wish them all the very best."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Tahir</b>: "I can't complain. Thanks for the people's support from back home and to all the people who have come here to support us. I really don't know what to say. I am just really pleased. All my hard work paid off today and I am really glad. This is what I've got, everything from South Africa. I always feel that I have to pay the country back. I am really pleased and really honoured to be part of this team. Playing with some great players, I just want to do my role. It's an absolute honour, I am really loving it. If you look at our team, there are some really good and great players. Playing with them is a dream come true and then everyday I get up to feel that I am going to be playing with these guys again. It's just a great feeling and that's what motivates me everyday. I think that's what makes me do well. Definitely, this is the dream (talking about winning the cup). We've been really working hard as a team for this and we are really hoping for another two good games in our pocket. We've been doing our hard work. It just depends on how we deliver on that day. I am backing our boys."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Imran Tahir</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his <b>4/26</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Unfortunately, due to this loss, the legends of Sri Lankan cricket, Sangakkara and Jayawardene couldn't end their glittering careers on a high. South Africa played with an aggressive intent and there is no doubt they have sent a strong message to the rest of the teams in the competition that they are serious contenders to lift the coveted trophy.    <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Even seasoned campaigners, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene couldn't revive the sagging spirits of what seemed like a defeated camp. In fact, Sangakkara struggled to rotate the strike and there were passages of play when he looked out of his depth. It was Lahiru Thirimanne, who checked in a slew of fine strokes and tried to up the tempo. However, once he lost his wicket to Tahir, they couldn't recover. Only when Sri Lanka lost eight wickets, Sangakkara finally looked to take on South Africa's bowlers. In short, all of Sri Lanka's batsmen seemed to be weighed down by the fact that they were playing a big game. Among the bowlers, the debutant Tharindu Kaushal, troubled South Africa's openers, but their bowlers had too much to do.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, South African bowlers put up a thoroughly professional performance to rip through the opposition's batting line-up. Dale Steyn and Kyle Abbott bowled with fire and aggression to take wickets early on in the innings. Once Steyn and Abbott put the opposition on the back foot, Tahir made his presence felt. None of Sri Lanka's batsmen picked the googly and Tahir ended up with four wickets to his name.  Tahir also outfoxed the batsmen with subtle changes of pace. Duminy too snared crucial wickets and even took a hat-trick. Incidentally, he became the first South African to take a hat-trick in World Cups.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[After Imran Tahir and JP Duminy shared seven wickets between them, Quinton de Kock played with composure to brush aside the opposition's challenge and help South Africa reach the semi-finals. While chasing down a modest target, de Kock and Hashim Amla looked to play aggressively, and it was obvious that South Africa would coast towards victory. The think-tank, in particular, would be pleased with de Kock finding his touch as he composed a quick-fire half-century. This was their first win in knockouts in World Cups. This win also turned out to be the largest victory in terms of balls remaining in knockout games of the World Cup.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[ <b>Sad end to Mahela Jayawardene's international career and Kumar Sangakkara's ODI career</b>. Sri Lanka would have wanted to give both the legends a fitting farewell by winning the cup, but it was not to be. They couldn't have asked for anything better. A quarter-final at the SCG, which resembled the SSC last Sunday, is just what they wanted, but they were simply not good enough on the day. The South African players shake hands with Sangakkara and Jayawardene. Miller has a long chat with the former. Now Sanga and Mahela hug each other.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Allan Donald is happy on the sidelines. Sangakkara walks up to Faf and de Kock to congratulate them. After having a chat with de Kock, he hugs him as well. Jayawardene looks dejected as he walks to congratulate the South African players. de Kock hugs Faf, while their team-mates congratulate each other. Sangakkara waves to the crowd as he walks off the field. Both de Kock and Faf allow Sanga and Mahela to lead the players off the field. The entire South African team comes down to congratulate Sanga and Mahela on a great career.]]></line><line><![CDATA[17.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malinga to de Kock, <b>FOUR</b>, <b>South Africa are in the semis.

I guess there is a little bit of added pressure to that (talking about him being doing the fifth bowler's job). Obviously my past performances with the ball in this tournament haven't been good. So it was good to get a good go here today. To bowl 9 overs and obviously contribute to the team was great. It's been a long time coming for me to contribute with the ball. I've been working hard at the bowling side of my game, so I am pretty pleased with that. There wasn't really a lot of purchase out there, so it was just about keeping the runs down, keeping the singles down and putting the pressure on them and hoping that they would make the mistakes. Fortunately enough, it worked out for us."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>18:20 Local Time, 07:20 GMT, 12:50 IST:</b>  On that note, the umpires have decided to take the supper break. The first session was extended because of the rain earlier. South Africa are off to a very good start. Although Amla has been dismissed, the momentum is still with them. South Africa will be delighted to see Quinton de Kock, who has not performed well so far in the tournament, bat freely. With just 94 runs to get, this should just be a formality for the Proteas. However, both Amla and de Kock found it difficult to read mystery spinner Tharindu Kaushal. Can Sri Lanka put up a spirited show and pull off an unlikely win?

It was only after they lost eight wickets, did he open up his shoulders to thump a few boundaries. The bowlers built pressure on Sangakkara by joining the dots, but it was a strange innings from the lynchpin of the line-up. The champion batsman was finally dismissed for 45. The South African camp would be delighted with the efforts of their bowlers. Their fielding was top notch as well.

Both of them bowled with unrelenting control and ripped through the top-order. It was Lahiru Thirimanne, who shored up Sri Lanka's innings by unfurling a series of fine shots. However, once Thirimanne was dismissed by Tahir, they sloped towards a paltry total. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Imran Tahir and JP Duminy's splendid spells helped South Africa to skittle out the opposition for a modest total. Tahir, with his variations, kept the Sri Lankan batsmen in check and was rewarded for his efforts with four wickets. To put the icing on the cake, Duminy too snaffled three wickets and became only the first South African to pick up a hat-trick in World Cups. None of Sri Lanka's batsmen seemed to pick Tahir's googly and clever changes of pace. Even Kumar Sangakkara, who has amassed four back-to-back hundreds in this World Cup, struggled for timing and placement. In particular, Mahela Jayawardene looked all at sea against Tahir.]]></line><line><![CDATA[37.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahir to Malinga, <b>out</b> Caught by D Miller!! All over. Tahir finishes with four.

He is now having a chat with Malinga. Is the bat in the air? Only one look at the replay and it is given not out. Why can't the third umpire have more looks at replays?

While walking back, Sanga asked him whether he nicked it and he nodded. Sanga just punched his gloves and sent him. Also Duminy said - 'well played' or something along those lines to Kula. That's what I could get from my lip-reading skills. A great moment in a super-charged atmosphere.

In fact, had not even noticed that Duminy was on a hat-trick. When Duminy took a hat-trick, looks like he was the only one who knew. Or did he?

More on that later. Let's come back to the wicket. Short and Sangakkara went back to cut, timed it well, but found Miller who clutched it onto his chest and tumbled backwards. Sangakkara found the fielder perfectly. Walks off perhaps for the last time in ODIs, with the rain giving him a fitting farewell.

He also rarely wastes a bouncer. Another key ingredient of Steyn's bowling is that he seems to have a great 'feel' for the ball and that helps him to penetrate every crevice in a batsman’s defence and plot his dismissal with those subtle changes of wrist and fingers. Steyn has undoubtedly come a long way from the days when Phil Jacques plundered him for runs in an ODI against Australia in Melbourne (Docklands) in 2005 to become the spearhead of the pace attack. Let us have a look at his partner in crime, Morkel, in the next part. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Born with those 'fast-twitch muscle fibres' he was made to bowl quick. With an effortless run-up and a side-on action, Steyn bowls razor sharp outswingers and hurries the batsman with pace. Steyn also zips through the crease quickly. He never snaps or rams his front leg hard. In fact, it is hard to remember a fast bowler, who could go through the crease quicker. When one discusses this aspect of Steyn with old-timers, there is a feeling that Malcolm Marshall was the one bowler, who matched him in that regard.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Over the years, Steyn and Morkel have established themselves as a fearsome pace duo. So, here is also a look at the lynchpins of South Africa's pace attack. The silkiness of the run-up, dazzling range of weaponry and those cold determined eyes with which Steyn dismantles opposition ranks can leave you spellbound. Steyn, the small town boy from Phalaborwa, is certainly bestowed with god-gifted skills.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[On the other hand, Dale Steyn found a bit of shape away from the right-handed Tillakaratne Dilshan and eventually, dismissed him with a short of a length delivery. However, South Africa would be concerned with the fact that Steyn seemed to have a problem with his neck. It was Morne Morkel, who replaced Steyn, and he extracted searing bounce from a length and bowled with very good pace. However, he struggled with his line. Their opponents, Sri Lanka, need Sangakkara to play one of those masterful knocks. It is curious to note that for a knockout game, Sri Lanka decided to open with Perera instead of Lahiru Thirimanne, who has been in fine form in this World Cup. In fact, it was Thirimanne, who looked to take on the South African bowlers by essaying a few boundaries.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[It was Kyle Abbott, who made the initial breakthrough by dismissing Kushal Perera. It was a nervy innings by Perera as he looked to slash at anything that was outside the off-stump and paid the price. When Perera isn't given the chance to free his arms, he struggles. The credit has to go to Abbott for pitching the ball up and drawing the batsman forward, and Quinton de Kock for taking an excellent catch behind the stumps. Abbott has been in fine form for South Africa in this World Cup. He also troubled Kumar Sangakkara by shaping it back into him and a close lbw shout was turned down. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Time for <b>drinks</b>.

Superb take by de Kock, albeit off the second attempt. It was a terrific delivery from Kyle Abbott, he forced Perera to defend and the thick outside edge was found, it seemed to be going to Amla at first slip, but de Kock dived across and went with one glove. He was airborne as he stretched out and the ball slipped out the first time, but the keeper showed great reflexes to hang on before the ball hit the turf. He throws the ball away in delight and the South Africans are cock-a-hoop. The ploy to send Perera has flopped badly.

We also got to start nice and fresh. It's a great opportunity for the guys to shine here today. We are representing a lot of people back home and they are waking up nice and early this morning to watch us. So we've got to play a good game of cricket and make them proud. Every time I walk out in these colours, my heart beats pretty fast. I get very excited representing my country and I am very excited to perform well today. Probably yes (when asked if he would have batted first). We are prepared to face whatever comes our way. Things in quarterfinals and big matches in World Cups don't always go your way. We know if we play to our potential, no one is going to stop us in this tournament. So that's what we are going to focus on today, to hit our straps from the word go and find a few weaknesses in the opposition. We rate ourselves to chase whatever total Sri Lanka gets, we rate ourselves to chase against their bowling line-up. Faf (du Plessis) is fit and he's back in place of Farhaan Behardien, Vernon (Philander) misses out for (Kyle) Abbott. Well, I am the back up (very happy, smiles - when asked if there were any back up bowlers). The calmness is great. Everything is in place. It's just a matter of winning this game today. That's what it's comes down to. We have got our eyes set on our goals. Got to take one step at a time, start well today and I believe we'll come out on top."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Mathews:</b> "We've got to start afresh. It's a new game, a new opposition and we have to play good cricket to win against them. This is a beautiful stadium. Hope people will turn up to support us. We will have a <b>bat</b> first. The wicket is nice and hard, it's pretty hot. Well, it's obviously big quarterfinal so we look to bat first, put runs on the board and obviously the pressure will take it to them. Rangana (Herath) is not fit so we have drafted in Tharindu Kaushal. He's a mystery spinner, so he's going to make his debut. He's kind of a duplicate Muralitharan (smiles). So I am really excited to see him bowl today. Everyone is fit."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Live visuals show that <b>Tharindu Kaushal</b> is being congratulated by his team-mates in the team huddle. He is all smiles and looks like he will make his ODI debut. What a day for the youngster. He has come in to the tournament as a replacement for <b>Herath who has been ruled out of the World Cup</b>.

Chief national selector Sanath Jayasuriya said Herath was finding it painful to bowl as the injury had not healed. "He had the stitches removed two days ago.

Angelo Mathews wants his side to win the World Cup for Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena. "We've talked about it quite a lot, and we look to try to make this tournament a memorable one for them. They've been performing really well. Kumar has been brilliant in the past four games for us, and hopefully he can get one more (hundred) tomorrow. Obviously, Kumar is one of the hardest workers I've ever seen. He's the first one to get into the nets and the last to get out of the nets. Mahela got a brilliant hundred against Afghanistan but since then he hasn't had the opportunity to have a good knock. He is a big match player and the top four have to score runs for us to be in contention. Hopefully, we can make it an historical one winning tomorrow and go into the semi-finals again. Hopefully, we can go to the final and win there and make it historical for the legends. But before looking at the final, we need to try to take one game at a time."]]></line><line><![CDATA["He has been in these situations a lot of time with real life experiences, not just facing a cricket ball.

Every time we get to these events, it is going to be questioned. We have spoken about it, no doubt about it.

Simple," he said on the eve of the game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Malinga looks short of his very best and the other bowlers haven't quite scaled up. The spin attack without Herath doesn't possess a threat at all. The injuries too haven't helped at all as Dammika Prasad was ruled out before the tournament started. Sri Lanka badly need Herath to be fit for the quarter-final to give them genuine wicket-taking options.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Road to the quarter-final:</b> Sri Lanka won convincingly against Bangladesh, England and Scotland to finish third in the group. Sangakkara is in the form of his life as he became the first man to score four ODI hundreds in a row. Can he make it five on the trot? Looking at the form he is in, one wouldn't bet against him. Dilshan, Thirimanne and Jayawardena too have made hundreds, while Mathews has chipped in with cameos. It is the bowling that lacks bite as Australia and New Zealand ruthlessly exploited. Even England managed a 300 plus score against the Sri Lankans.]]></line><line><![CDATA[While South Africa haven't been the dominant team that everyone expected them to be before the tournament's start, Sri Lanka have quietly gone about their business and seemed to revelling in the attention some of the other sides have been getting. Their campaign got off to a bad start with a loss to New Zealand while it was Mahela Jayawardena's class that ensured points against gritty Afghanistan. They were in a tight corner until Mahela bailed them out, to save themselves an embarrassing defeat. Against Australia they were blown away by Maxwell, but they put up a fantastic fight and were well on course until Chandimal's injury forced him to retire hurt.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Quinton de Kock has been a big letdown at the top while Duminy and Miller look suspect when the pressure is on. Amla made a stroke-filled hundred against Ireland and a 65 against West Indies but hasn't had a score apart from that game. That has left de Villiers to carry the burden on his shoulders. Also the number 7 spot looks unsettled with South Africa unsure about whom to play. Dale Steyn hasn't been firing on all cylinders with the ball and that has left the bowling lacking that killer instinct.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Road to the quarter-final:</b> South Africa have had a mixed tournament so far. They annihilated West Indies and Ireland, posting over 400, becoming the first side in ODIs to post successive 400 plus totals. But against India and Pakistan, they were well beaten while chasing a target. India outplayed them in all departments at MCG while Pakistan were inspired with the ball at Eden Park. Zimbabwe gave South Africa a good fight, but couldn't sustain the momentum in the chase, losing in the end.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Will history repeat itself?

Their opponents in today's quarter-final. Winners in 1996. Runners-up in 2007 and 2011. Sri Lanka at one point had a streak of 4 ICC finals - without winning anything - if you take in, the 2009 and 2012 ICC World T20 tournaments as well. But that barren run was broken in 2014 when they beat India to win the T20 World Cup.

Once again and for the umpteenth time, South Africa had flattered to deceive in a World Cup.]]></line><line><![CDATA[After winning five out of their six league games in the 2011 World Cup, including a thrilling game against eventual winners India, South Africa were expected to thrash New Zealand in the quarter-final at Dhaka. But what happened eventually was mind-boggling. Chasing New Zealand's 222, South Africa were coasting at 108/2 with Kallis and de Villiers batting superbly. Just then, the big tall Jacob Oram produced a moment of inspiration at the deep mid-wicket boundary that turned the game. He pulled off an athletic running catch and that wicket of Kallis sparked a collapse.]]></line><line><![CDATA[In 2007 it was a crushing defeat. South Africa were bundled over for 149 in the semi-final against a rampant Aussie side. The chase was a cakewalk from then on. It was one of the most one-sided semi-finals in World Cup history.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Former batsman turned TV commentator Andrew Hudson summed it up best when he had these words: "42 million South Africans are going to bed tonight hoping it was a bad dream".]]></line><line><![CDATA[Murali was the bowler and Boucher heaved a six over wide long-on off the penultimate ball of the over and promptly punched the air, thinking he had done enough. He calmly turned the last ball to mid-wicket and didn't take the single. Expectedly the umpires took the players off after the end of the 45th over. Further rain meant no more play was possible. But to South Africa's shock and horror, the score needed to win was 230 and 229 was just good enough for a tie. South Africa had been knocked out due to a mathematical error caused by one of their own and left them distraught and speechless.]]></line><line><![CDATA[In 2003, it was a D/L calculation error that cost South Africa a chance to move into the knockout stages. South Africa needed a win to go through in their last group match against Sri Lanka. They were chasing 269 and it was rain once again which had threatened to make it a nightmare for them. The South African dressing room sent a message to Mark Boucher who was at the crease then, that  229 was the score they needed to be on by the end of the 45th, assuming no further wickets fell.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There are a couple of iconic images that will forever be transfixed in a cricket fan's mind. The sight of Klusener walking back being escorted by a big security guard. Hansie Cronje standing shell-shocked, watching from a glass window in front of him. The Aussies celebrating all in one frame as Gilchrist broke the stumps. Donald, crest-fallen picking up his bat and gear. What images and what memories it brings back till this day. Australia were through to the final and South Africa out. The best team in the tournament by a mile had once again flopped.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Next ball, the unthinkable happened from a South African perspective. Klusener mistimed one to mid-off and just ran. He didn't call or look at Donald. He hit it and ran. Mark Waugh was at mid-off. One of Australia's best fielders ever. His ice-coolness, just like his twin Steve, helped Australia. Mark Waugh moved swiftly to his left and backhanded a flick to Fleming. Fleming's cricketing nous and sense came to the fore as he calmly rolled the ball to Gilchrist who ran Donald out. Donald had lost his bat and had begun to run as he saw Klusener run past him. But he was caught yards short as Gilchrist whipped the bails off and celebrated.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Damien Fleming was the man under pressure and off the third ball, Darren Lehmann had a chance to run Allan Donald out at the non-striker's end as the pacer was out of his crease but missed the target. Donald looked skywards and heaved a sigh of relief with a nervous smile dotting his lips. That should've been a big warning. South Africa weren't home yet, they needed the one run, for a tie would see the Aussies go through as they had beaten them in the Super Six stage.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Steve Waugh had no other option but to bring the field in and he just did that. Did that play on Klusener's mind? Or did he want to finish it off in one blaze of glory? Was he nervous? Was he tense? What was he thinking? His body language and facial expressions didn't suggest anything at all. He was like Pete Sampras. Stoic!]]></line><line><![CDATA[If you thought, this was drama then this is nothing. Wait till we get to the end. Australia held all the aces going into the final over of the game bowled by Damien Fleming. South Africa needed 9 with the last pair of Lance Klusener and Allan Donald at the crease. But Klusener showed his striking prowess by drilling the first two balls through extra cover - the two of the hardest hits you will ever see - as he tied the match. Just a single was needed now and it was advantage South Africa.]]></line><line><![CDATA[But such was his unbreakable resolve and unshakeable self-belief, that Warnie effectively brought Australia back into the contest with three wickets in quick time. Gibbs was bamboozled by a trademark big leggie, Kirsten was bowled by another ripping leg-break while Cronje was wrongly ruled out, with the ball coming off the boot. The game though had swung towards Australia and Warne had created an opening from nothing.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It had the likes of Kirsten, Gibbs, Cullinan, Cronje, Kallis, Rhodes and Co. South Africa got off to a solid start too, with them getting to 48/0. Enter Shane Warne as Steve Waugh threw the ball to his ace leggie. Warne was out-of-sorts in the tournament so far and even had contemplated thoughts about premature retirement earlier in the year. He was smashed by New Zealand and Pakistan in the league stages and his confidence wasn't great.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The 1999 World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia will go down as one of the greatest games in ODI history. Such was the twists and turns that kept everyone hooked to their seats. It was see-sawing till the last ball. Drama at its highest. Worthy of an Oscar-winning movie. Australia had just made 213 as Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald shared 9 wickets making full use of bowling first conditions at Birmingham. The target seemed to be too little for such a strong batting line-up that South Africa possessed at that time.]]></line><line><![CDATA[If rain had robbed South Africa of a possible final spot in 1992, their campaign was brought to an abrupt end by Brian Lara's class in 1996. Having won all their five matches in the league stage, South Africa were firm favorites in 1996 to go all the way. But at Karachi, in a knockout game it was Brian Lara who  weaved magic with the bat. His 94-ball 111 studded with 16 boundaries helped West Indies post a good total of 264 on the board. And then their bowlers came to the party. The spinners, Roger Harper and Jimmy Adams took 7 wickets amongst themselves as South Africa fell 19 runs short.]]></line><line><![CDATA["South Africa's chances of reaching the final floundered on a rule which no-one had bothered to think through," wrote John Woodcock in The Cricketer. "For so important an event to be reduced at times to a lottery must have been a source of great embarrassment to the organisers, though to the best of my knowledge they came nowhere near to admitting it. It is difficult to avoid the impression that the Australian Cricket Board are obliged to defer to television, by which I mean to Mr Packer's Channel Nine and all their delirious ways."]]></line><line><![CDATA[The term Ch*** - didn't begin to haunt South Africa until 1999, but one has to feel a bit sorry for what happened to them in 1992. Playing against England at the SCG the match was nicely poised with the Proteas needing 22 off 13 balls when the skies opened up. Just the 12 minutes of rain was enough to ruin a nation's dream as the dreaded rain rule made its appearance. The giant screen at the SCG showed South Africa needed 22 off 1 ball when the rain stopped much to the shock and frustration of the African nation. But such was the rain rule back then. When play restarted just to complete the formality, Brian McMillan defended Chris Lewis' last ball - bowled from a very short run - for a single and walked off in a huff. South Africa were angry, while England were a bit embarrassed by all the shenanigans that had unfolded in front of their eyes.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Before we go any further, let us go back a little bit. Back till 1992 because that's when South Africa's tryst with World Cups began. We will look at each and every knockout/their final game in those tournaments as we cast our minds back to what happened that caused their eventual exit. This will be joyful/painful depending on whether you are a South African supporter or not. What about us? I hate stating the obvious, but sometimes you have to do that. We are neutral and it is just our job to bring you the best coverage possible. So on that note, let's begin. This is going to be a treat. So enjoy!]]></line><line><![CDATA[On that slightly awkward note - awkward just because we didn't want to bring that word up, but had to - we welcome you to our coverage of the first quarter-final between Sri Lanka and South Africa being played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Hope you are settled in warmly - wherever you may be - armed with whatever that pleases you - from hot brews to a chilled one, to food of all varieties -  as you need lots of time and attention to read through our varied and delightful description of this big game. This is a huge game, the quarter-final of a World Cup and we will ensure nothing escapes our grasp.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Ch*** - 'fail to perform at a crucial point of a game or contest as a result of nervousness.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>12:30 Local Time, 01:30 GMT, 07:00 IST:</b> Five knockout matches in World Cups. Since 1992. That's 23 years and counting. Five defeats. Zero wins. For a team that possessed the likes of Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald, Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock, Lance Klusener, Jonty Rhodes, Daryll Cullinan, Herschelle Gibbs, Graeme Smith, and many more. The best all-round side entering into any big tournament. Invariably one of the favorites going into the mega event. But still they can't seem to get over the line. What could be the reason? Nerves, pressure, inability to deliver the crunching blow. Unable to live up to the favorites tag? No! There is one word that starts with 'C' and unfortunately - even though they hate that word associated to their name - South Africa have been called just that. We won't mention that word - that would be doing a disservice, but here is what the English dictionary says about what it means in a sporting context.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b> by <b>G Rajaraman</b><br/><br/>A colourful and noisy house will be in attendance as South Africa and Sri Lanka clash at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday in what can be the best of the quarterfinals games in the ICC Cricket World Cup. Hopefully, curator Tom Parker and his team will roll out a track on which the outcome of the high-voltage game will not depend only on the toss.<br/><br/>The teams have similarities they lost two games each in the league phase; they have had pretty much an even record against one another in the past couple of years; and, they are both hungrily nervous ahead the big game. They have differences, too Sri Lanka have a history of doing well at the World Cup competitions while South Africa are seeking to break new ground.<br/><br/>The teams are blessed with experienced batsmen who can deliver on the big stage but with a more balanced bowling attack, South Africa can fancy themselves of achieving that dream first win in a World Cup play-off game and then head to Auckland for the semifinal. Sri Lanka are yet to find a bowling combination that can stop the talented and determined teams.<br/><br/>If, despite the talk, South Africa take the ghosts of past along with them to the park, they will court trouble. The other significant thing that can stop them from realising their passionate dream of winning a knockout game in the world's premier cricket tournament is Sri Lanka's batting, especially if Angelo Matthews' team takes first strike.<br/><br/>Kumar Sangakkara's incredible purple patch has fetched him a tournament high of 496 runs, including four centuries, from six league games while opener Tillakaratne Dilshan is just five runs shy of the 400-run mark. Lahiru Thirimanne has contributed to the Sri Lankan top-order looking the most productive in the tournament.<br/><br/>Sri Lanka have the experience of winning big games but they cannot forget that their bowling unit has not been their strongest suit. Paceman Lasith Malinga was gingerly on his comeback from ankle surgery and the team is still sweating over left-arm spinner Rangana Herath's return from a split finger that needed stitches and kept him out of the last two games.<br/><br/>With a set of stroke-players who can win games on their own, South Africa will need Hashim Amla to play an anchoring effort. Of the batsmen left in the tournament, AB de Villiers is the only one besides Sangakkara to have logged more than 400 runs so far. South Africa's batsmen were not up to scratch when chasing targets set by India and Pakistan.<br/><br/>Talking of losses, Sri Lanka's defeats by co-hosts New Zealand and Australia showed their vulnerabilities, too. As they prepare for battle on Wednesday at SCG whose tracks in the three World Cup games have been on the slower side, Sri Lanka and South Africa will both be looking to avert making mistakes under pressure.<br/><br/>Fans who will throng the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground will be hoping for a humdinger, with the team that holds their nerves getting their nose ahead. It would be a travesty if winning the toss has a direct bearing on the outcome of the game. Certainly, that was the case when South Africa beat the West Indies and Sri Lanka chased a tall score by Australia at the venue.<br/><br/>England bucked the trend by winning after choosing to field first but against Afghanistan. Only a Herculean bowling effort in the afternoon can ensure the replication of that on Wednesday. South Africa are better equipped to achieve that than Sri Lanka. They chose not to train on Tuesday, wanting to keep their minds fresh.<br/><br/>But the moot question remains: Does South Africa's will to win have the strength to overpower their raging desire not to lose in the playoff again?]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>South Africa</b> (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle Abbott]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sri Lanka</b> (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Kushal Janith Perera, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Sachithra Senanayake, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Upul Tharanga]]></line>
