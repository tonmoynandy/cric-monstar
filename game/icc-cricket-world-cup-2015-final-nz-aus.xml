			<line><![CDATA[This has been a great World Cup and we enjoyed bringing every bit of it to you. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as well. Looking forward to your company on April 8 for the start of the T20 extravaganza. On behalf of <b>Srivathsa</b>, <b>Pradeep</b>, <b>Akshay</b>, <b>Sidhant</b>, <b>Raju</b>, <b>Krishna</b>, <b>Sriram</b> and <b>Bharath</b>, this is <b>Ramakrishnan</b> saying goodbye for one final time. Take care!]]></line><line><![CDATA[It's a great day for Player of the Series Mitchell Starc and Player of the Match James Faulkner in their young careers.]]></line><line><![CDATA[David Warner's 178. Pakistan's inspiring victory against the Proteas. Bangladesh stunning England and knocking them out at Adelaide. Teams failing to keep the Indian bowlers at bay. Brendan Taylor's goodbye to Zimbabwe. JP Duminy's hat-trick against Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara bowing out on a sad note. Wahab Riaz's jaw-dropping spell against Australia. Grant Elliott denying his country of birth in the semi-final. Steven Smith's love affair with India. Daniel Vettori calling time on his international career. These are some of the moments that I could recollect. Phew! What a treat we had.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's relive some more moments for one last time. Steven Finn's hat-trick. James Taylor denied a hundred because of an umpiring blunder. A high-profile clash between India and Pakistan. Ireland thumping West Indies and proving that it was right to include the Associates. Tim Southee rattling England. Afghanistan scaring Sri Lanka. Chris Gayle's double-hundred. Samiullah Shenwari's brilliance with the bat. The AB de Villiers assault at the SCG. That insane game at the Eden Park between the Trans-Tasman rivals. Kumar Sangakkara scoring hundreds at will. South Africa becoming the first team to score 400 in successive games.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Although Australia weren't as ruthless as they were before in this World Cup, they managed to grab key moments, which was key to their successful journey. The fact that they managed to win the title despite not playing their perfect game in the entire tournament speaks volumes of the depth they have in their outfit. Mitchell Starc outclassing Mitchell Johnson was a sight to watch. Overall, the Australian boys have given a perfect farewell gift for their captain Michael Clarke, who has hung up his ODI boots.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There were so many moments to savour in this World Cup. Let's begin with today and the two teams that were on show today. Brendon McCullum's courageous captaincy - he was not afraid to have four slips and leave the off-side field open looking for wickets early on. His field placings gave a lot of confidence to Boult and Southee, who were exceptional with the new ball throughout the tournament. Baz himself led from the front in the field with his acrobatic efforts. New Zealand's confidence as a whole unit even under pressure was good to see.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Inside the Australian dressing room, Barry 'Nugget' Rees, a former South Australian player, a close friend of coach Darren Lehmann and an inspirational figure in the Australian team for a number of years, pours beer on the World Cup trophy and kisses the cup. He makes a speech to the team. The Australian players then have a beer.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at some of the best <b>tweets</b> from this game: ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@gauravkalra75:</b> australia have now won world cups in asia, europe, africa, north america & australia. only south america & antarctica remain! #CWC15Final]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@BrianLara:</b> Well played Australia you were the best team by far and your wins from the quarterfinals onwards were clinical and showed your superiority!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@cricket_U:</b> Back to back World Cup Final wins for the home team.

As the curtains fell on the mega event, we leave you with all the <b>records</b> that were broken and landmarks that were achieved during the course of the tournament: ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Martin Guptill was in supreme touch during the later part of the World Cup and ended up as the highest run-scorer of the tournament with <b>547 runs.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Kumar Sangakkara, the fulcrum of Sri Lanka's batting line-up, became the first cricketer to notch up <b>four back-to-back tons in ODIs.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult were consistently amongst the wickets and ended up as the highest wicket-takers of the tournament with <b>22 wickets.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Martin Guptill went on to post the <b>highest individual score</b> in World Cups with a rousing innings of <b>237</b> not out against the West Indies. Interestingly, Chris Gayle had earlier become the first cricketer to crack a double ton in World Cups, when he achieved that feat against Zimbabwe in Canberra. Guptill now also has the second highest individual score in ODIs to his name.]]></line><line><![CDATA[While compiling a splendid innings of 162 not out against the West Indies in Sydney, AB de Villiers became the fastest to reach 150 in ODIs. He reached that feat in a mere <b>64 balls.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand's captain, Brendon McCullum, played with a dash of adventurism against England in Wellington to register the fastest fifty in World Cups. He completed his fifty in just <b>18 balls.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia's monstrous score of <b>417 for 6</b> against Afghanistan at the WACA was the highest total in World Cups.]]></line><line><![CDATA[With <b>37 sixes,</b> Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers now have thwacked most number of sixes in World Cups. Now, <b>26</b> of those Gayle's sixes came in this World Cup and that turned out to be a record for most number of sixes smashed in a single World Cup.]]></line><line><![CDATA[By clobbering Zimbabwe's bowlers for <b>16 sixes</b> in Canberra, Chris Gayle equalled Rohit Sharma's record for most number sixes in an ODI innings.]]></line><line><![CDATA[With as many as <b>31 sixes</b> being hammered, the quarter-final match between New Zealand and West Indies in Wellington saw the most sixes smashed in a World Cup match.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Maxwell runs behind the advertisement boards near the boundary and does high-fives with the crowd. The Australian players now sing the team song as they walk across the outfield.]]></line><line><![CDATA[ICC Chairman N Srinivasan hands over the World Cup trophy to Michael Clarke and the celebrations begin. They now pose for the cameras. Woo hoos are heard all over. Big smile on every single player of the Australian team and why not. David Warner pours champagne on Shane Watson and Steven Smith. The Australians do a lap of honour with the trophy in their hands. Clarke is seen clapping his hands to the fans. Clarke gets a bit emotional as well. Ah! Darren Lehmann remembered 1999 I guess. He takes the trophy and holds it high. Clarke now poses with the cup as photographers try to capture the moment.]]></line><line><![CDATA["I might give it back to Warnie (when asked if he would hand his No. 23 jersey to anybody). I haven't thought too much about it to be honest. It's been an honour and a privilege to represent my country in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. The time is right for me to walk away from one-day cricket, but I'll keep playing Test cricket. I don't know I have to think about the number 23 (jersey), but I am honoured to have received it from Shane Warne. I am very proud to wear it and tonight has been extra special.  As you can see it has got PH on it (when Mark Nicholas asked him about the black armband he was wearing). I will wear it every game I play for Australia. For everybody in Australian cricket it's been a really tough few months and I am sure I don't speak just for myself. I am sure everybody standing on the stage tonight will say that we played this World Cup with 16 players and tonight is certainly dedicated to Phil Hughes. Hughesy used to party as good as any of them, so we'll make sure that we drink two at a time tonight. One for Hughesy and one for us. We are really proud and it's a wonderful achievement. It's a great thing just to make the World Cup final, but to be able to win in your own backyard in front of your family and friends is extremely special. I can guarantee, we'll celebrate hard tonight."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Clarke</b>: "Obviously I am over the moon. What a tournament. Firstly, to Brendon (McCullum) and the New Zealand team, they deserve a lot of credit there. They are always a tough team to beat. It seems in any sporting event, Australia v New Zealand is always an exciting contest and tonight was no different. So to Baz and his team, congratulations on a wonderful tournament mate and well done. Especially personally, you were outstanding throughout the whole tournament. To the Australian fans, to all the fans of the game of cricket, I think it's been an amazing turnout for this tournament. People watching at home on TV and people coming to all the games, to the support that we had throughout the tournament, thanks to every Australian and every cricket supporter out there. Most importantly to our amazing team including support staff that stands over there, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The support I've received since coming back into the team, the way they have stood up and played, they deserve to certainly stand here tonight and hold that trophy up. We have played really well tonight. I said after the semi-final I think the guys were certainly ready for this final mentally. We had to recover physically and it's a great strength of our team. The support staff we have, the medical staff do a great job in getting everybody fit and healthy and the guys were ready for tonight and they played really well once again."]]></line><line><![CDATA[It's now time for the Australian team to collect their medallions. Big roar from the crowd as Mark Nicholas reads out Michael Clarke's name.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Starc</b>: "I don't know what words to use. It was an amazing tournament, some outstanding performances, but today to cap it off (was amazing). New Zealand have been a great team throughout the whole tournament. They really set the benchmark, but I think we came hard today and really led to this performance. I wouldn't say that (when asked if he was the best fast bowler in the world at the moment). I've worked really hard at it for a number of months now with Craig McDermott (the bowling coach) in the background. I think a few series ago we sat down and penned down a little plan. To see it come to fruition tonight or through the whole tournament, it's been phenomenal. There was a lot of luck involved I think (referring to the ball to dismiss Brendon McCullum). There was a little plan that Craig and I had going a couple of days ago, to see it get executed really but Brendon has been fantastic throughout the tournament, so I think there was luck involved and I am just happy to get that one. The support from the Australian public and the crowd here has been fantastic through the whole tournament for us. So thank you all. To play in front of this crowd, in front of these many people, is nothing like it. I would like to (when asked if he can go on and produce something like this in all formats), but I am just going to enjoy this one for now."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Mitchell Starc</b> is the <b>Player of the Tournament</b>. He picked up <b>22 wickets at an average of 10.18 in 8 innings,</b> Tendulkar gives him the award.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Faulkner</b>: "It's an amazing feeling, to play in front of 93,000 fans here at the MCG and win a World Cup is amazing. I will try and chip in and play my role for the team but what a performance today. It's been an amazing couple of years as an Australian one-day outfit. We brought our A game today. I suppose I get tossed the ball when the skipper wants me to bowl. Normally it's in the powerplay and I love that job. Today it worked out for us, but it can be tough sometimes. Definitely, I would be lying if I said there wasn't a moment when I thought I wouldn't be here today. But the physios looked after me and amazing, I am here today and it's an amazing feeling. I am not sure, you have to ask the senior members of the team (smiles, when asked what will happen tonight)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>James Faulkner</b> is the <b>Man of the Final</b> for his <b>3/36</b> and he receives the award from Sachin Tendulkar.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>McCullum</b>: "It's been one hell of a ride for us. Right throughout the way, we have played some outstanding cricket and we ran into an outstanding Australian team tonight, who continue to set the way in international cricket and full credit to them. They are deserved champions. Michael Clarke as well deserves to bow out as a World Cup champion too. All the best to them. They were outstanding in this World Cup and they thoroughly deserved to win. It was a quick one (referring to the ball Starc bowled to get rid of him). It all sort of unfolded probably not as we had planned, but I still thought we had got ourselves back in the game. 3/150, but as Australia do,  they came back at us again and to take 7/33 at the end, obviously put us under a lot of pressure. Still thought 180 we dared to dream. If we had a couple of things go our way, who knows what would have ended up. In the end, we were the second best team on the day. Again, credit to Australia. No regrets. This is the greatest stage that you can ask for as a cricketer. This is what you do your hard work for all the time, avail all the sacrifices that you make. We know we've had the opportunity as a group of guys to go on this ride and we have forged some memories and friendships which will last forever. Obviously we weren't able to lift the trophy, but the brand of cricket and the entertainment that we've been able to give people throughout our country but also throughout the world is something we are immensely proud of. We have no regrets and we walk away from this tournament with our heads held high. It is the greatest time of your life. To be able to represent your country on the international stage with a group of friends and then pit your skills against the world's best, it is the greatest time of our lives and that's how we have tried to play the game. Play with a free spirit and plenty of heart all the way along. It took us so far in this tournament, but obviously we weren't able to get past the final hurdle. As I said, I am immensely proud of all the guys within the team, all the management group and all those who have been a part of this team over the last few years and helped build us into what we are. We've still got some work to do, but I still think we can be very proud of our achievements in this tournament."]]></line><line><![CDATA[First up, the match officials receive their mementos. The New Zealand players now receive their medallions.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Presentation time!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Mitchell Marsh:</b> "It probably hasn't quite sunk in yet, but what a feeling. Although, we had a few blokes running on with the drinks, I am sure all of us will celebrate like we have made hundred and took 5-fers."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Cummins:</b> "It's been great. We both (him and Marsh) got a couple of games, but just being part of the 15, we had a lot of fun in the past five-six weeks. Good to be part of a bit of history. Even though we weren't playing, we still got the nerves the night before. It still feels like we are really part of it. The crowd today was fantastic."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Hazlewood:</b> "Starcy has been outstanding the whole tournament and to have Mitchell Johnson in the team and just see him leading the team, having that experience to talk to him and ask him stuff, is just outstanding."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Watson:</b> "It's what I have always dreamt of and it is to be involved in a World Cup final like this at the MCG, so impressed with the way we did it, it's just incredible. Absolutely, they have been the form side in world cricket for the last six months, especially in one-day cricket. Brendon McCullum has done an incredible job leading that team. They have got match-winners all the way through the whole team. We knew we had to be at our absolute best, lucky enough we were. What do you reckon? (when asked how long the celebrations will last, one night or one week)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Maxwell</b>: "That was incredible. Was just hoping that we don't lose another wicket because I would have happened to walk out there and I was pretty nervous. That was as good as it gets. Home final, MCG, 93,000, it doesn't get better than that. It has been a lot of fun and it has been a lot of fun while we were having success as well. Riding on the back of our wins has been great and tonight to not do a thing during this final has been even better. Watched the boys go about their business. Oh! you are right I did get a run-out (on being told he took a wicket)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bailey</b>: "Unreal. That was as special as it gets. A really big build-up and playing in front of a crowd like that, it must have been absolutely phenomenal. The build-up during the whole six weeks, then for the guys to put on such a wonderful performance tonight, that's one of the best feeling I ever had. You prefer to be playing no doubt about that, but to be part of the group has been so special and the whole journey has been amazing. I couldn't think of a better team to sit on the sidelines and watch, it has been the best seat in the house. It has been phenomenal. The players have been so outstanding, it's been an absolute privilege."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Starc</b>: "I had plenty of nerves. It was a little plan we had been working on, Craig McDermott and I for a couple of days, it's just nice to see it come off in front of a packed MCG. It was an amazing, amazing feeling during this World Cup and we just finished it off, it's just been amazing. All 15 guys, we were outstanding through the tri-series leading up to this World Cup. Right throughout, the staff have been fantastic, support of the Australian public, everyone in tonight has been an amazing feeling. It just really topped off the summer for everyone really."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Smith</b>: "Unbelievable feeling you know. We said that we wanted to play our best game towards the end of the tournament. To win this three down in the final, the boys were outstanding tonight. The bowlers really set it up for us. 180 on that wicket, they have done it all tournament. Thanks for all the fans for coming out tonight in front of 90,000 odd, what a better occasion, it was unbelievable. I would imagine so (on being thirsty tonight). It is not every day you win a World Cup. I know you (Shane Warne) have been part of one and it's a special feeling. I thought it was a very fitting farewell for Pup (Michael Clarke). He has been a terrific one-day player over a long period of time. I just wish he was out there with me at the end there. I was saying Pup, stay with me, stay with me and unfortunately he got out, but what a fitting farewell."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Finch:</b> "It's amazing. You always dream this as a kid and for it to finally happen, specially at home, at the MCG is an amazing feeling. When you get in a tournament, it is all about peaking at the right time. I think the way we played today, credit to everyone involved in that, to be able to restrict such a great side to around 180 and knock them off is unbelievable." ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Lehmann</b>: "They just keep coming up, front up for you day in and day out. They have been fantastic over these six weeks. The support we have had around Australia has been unbelievable. We thank everyone for coming out at the MCG to see two quality sides. It was a great result for us tonight. That's why I love them (when Haddin and Bailey threw a bucket of drinks on the coach). It was a great crowd. Obviously, supported both sides and that spirit lives on today in this ground. It's been fantastic for everyone that have come along and have enjoyed some good cricket. More than that I would think and why not? (on being asked whether the celebrations will last more than a week)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Haddin:</b> "It was special. We had not played a perfect game throughout the tournament and we delivered on the biggest stage. It's just a great feeling at the moment. We'll try and have a beer with every Aussie spectator in the building. So. it's going to be good fun tonight. It's been an amazing four weeks. We have enjoyed every minute. The support we have got all around Australia and even the little bit we got in New Zealand was good as well. The crowd support we got and how much all Australia appreciates this effort, it has been an enjoyable four weeks. I am thirsty as we speak. I want to try and have a beer with everyone in the place."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Warner:</b> "I have already lost my voice mate. It's a magical feeling. Credit to the guys, the bowlers did their job early on and gave us a good total to chase. We were pretty clinical there. You got to be positive and every game we have gone in, we have been a 100%, we have done all the right things. Today we came here and we expected a big crowd and thanks to everyone who came out and supported us throughout the tournament. Credit to you guys."]]></line><line><![CDATA[There are a lot of player interviews being conducted. We will have everything word by word. They will be up in a short while.]]></line><line><![CDATA[This victory certainly will be the crowning glory of those Australian cricketers, who lifted the glittering trophy. New Zealand too can be proud of their performance as they played with a positive mindset throughout the tournament to reach their first final. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia rode on the brilliance of Starc, Mitchell Johnson and Josh Hazlewood, with the new ball. If Starc swung it at pace, then Johnson and Hazlewood bowled back of a length and hit the bat hard. Faulkner with his box of tricks ran through the middle-order and took three scalps. Their fielding too was sharp. In short, Australia didn't put a foot wrong in the big game.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[It was Mitchell Starc, who gave them a perfect start by shattering Brendon McCullum's stumps to send the jam-packed crowd at the MCG into paroxysms of delight. Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson followed him back to the pavilion. Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor then stitched a century stand to resurrect their fortunes. It was James Faulkner, who put Australia in pole position by taking the wickets of Taylor and Corey Anderson in quick succession. Even though, Elliott continued to play a sterling knock, New Zealand's innings sloped towards a modest score.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[After being bundled out for a paltry score, Trent Boult gave New Zealand a glimmer of hope by snaffling Aaron Finch's wicket. However, once Smith and Clarke forged a superb partnership, the door was shut on their dream of winning the mega event for the first time. In fact, the credit also has to go to the bowlers, as they scythed through the New Zealand batting line-up.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Match summary:</b> Australia put their stamp on what was an authoritative show by chasing down the target with plenty of overs to spare. It was for the fifth time that they won the World Cup. Emotions were on full view, as on one side, the New Zealand players had a dejected look on their faces. At the other end of the spectrum, it turned out to be a red letter day for the opposition. It was an amazing performance from Australia and they deservedly got the chance to taste the glory of success. It also has to be remembered that this was Michael Clarke's last ODI and he signed off from the abridged version of the game in style by notching up a half-century. Steven Smith too scored a fine fifty.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Australian players rush onto the field to join Smith and Watson in their celebrations. The MCG goes berserk. The New Zealand players shake hands. McCullum hugs Vettori, who is retiring from international cricket. The Australians congratulate and hug each other. Coach Darren Lehmann is elated and is seen hugging every single player of the Australian team.]]></line><line><![CDATA[33.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to S Smith, <b>FOUR</b>, <b>Australia win the World Cup for the fifth time</b>. 1987 - Eden Gardens, 1999 - Lord's, 2003 - Wanderers, 2007 - Kensington Oval, but winning at the MCG at home must be really special. India did it four years ago chasing at the Wankhede in a final and today, Australia have done it at the MCG. Michael Clarke's won a World Cup in his first attempt as captain and what a way to end your ODI career. Shortish slower delivery just outside off stump, Smith rocks back and pulls it behind square on the on-side, the ball runs away to the fence.

Both the batsmen farmed the strike in a clinical manner. Initially, they found runs hard to come by, but Elliott frustrated Australia with cheeky shots through the third man region.

It was Martin Guptill, who soothed the nerves in the New Zealand camp with a fine cover-drive. Guptill, who has worked hard on his footwork with his mentor Martin Crowe, seems to have improved his game. New Zealand certainly need Guptill and Kane Williamson to steer them to safety.]]></line><line><![CDATA[As the summit clash between Trans-Tasman rivals, Australia and New Zealand got underway, the  fans were buzzing with excitement in anticipation of a riveting contest.

It's a shame that one team will have to win and one team will have to lose I guess. We are going to have <b>bat</b> first. The wicket looks outstanding, I think give ourselves great opportunity to put the runs on the board. We've got the same team. The guys were outstanding against a very good South African team. So we've given the opportunity in the final as well. We are really happy with the way the guys are. We know we will play well today, but it doesn't guarantee us success. But we know that we will be tough to beat. We have worked on this for a long time. We know that the game has its ups and downs, so we need to remain pretty stable emotionally. The guys are excited about today and certainly not fearful. We will go out there and display our skills the best we can and hopefully they will be good enough come the end of  the day. We've been very fortunate to have a lot of support from back home. Reading some of the articles, we had support from all around the world for us as well. It's going to be a great final.

Continue to play consistent cricket. We haven't done too much over the last couple of days. It was about recovery, making sure everybody was as fresh as possible for today. I said after the semi-final that the boys were mentally ready to go. Physically we've been able to get ourselves right and we are looking forward to today. It (support) is great.

He's picked the right players and they are playing for the right reason. Lehmann has brought it all together. Along with Michael, and now Smith, they've made sure that there is a terrific atmosphere in the team and that everybody has been able to relax. I think that Boof (Lehmann) has also been very big on family, making sure that players are not away for a long period of time without support.

I can tell you this much: I will be happy if Australia win, but I will be happier if New Zealand win it."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sourav Ganguly</b> writing exclusively on our site doesn't agree with the fact that since New Zealand are playing for the first time in Australia in the tournament, they will find it difficult. He writes: "Everyone here is saying Australia will win, and the reason they say is because New Zealand haven't played in Australia so far, which I don't agree with. They say the ball swung in New Zealand and it won't in Australia - I don't believe that either. The quality of Tim Southee and Trent Boult is much more than just conditions, and I think if they bowl in the right areas, they will get some swing and movement against Australia at the MCG. Don't forget though, that if the ball comes back into Aaron Finch and Steven Smith, who has been in outstanding form, they have been in trouble and Boult will look to do exactly that."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Southee said New Zealand were not too worried about having to play at the large MCG. "We've got guys who have played a lot of cricket around the world, on big grounds, on small grounds, we've got enough experience on big grounds.

The chance to play a World Cup final regardless of where you are in your career is something everyone dreams about," he stated.]]></line><line><![CDATA["He's been an outstanding contributor for us. He's played for New Zealand for half his life. (A win) would be a great way to potentially send him off. I guess it was potentially his last game on home soil and for him to be out there at the end and be as instrumental and as calm as he was under pressure, it was superb. He was struggling a bit with his back, too. He's played a lot of his career with bumps and bruises and niggles and strains. He's a tough customer and he's been an amazing servant," McCullum stated.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Vettori has said that Sunday's final will be his last for New Zealand. The curtains will draw for one last time. McCullum said the team would be working hard to ensure Vettori ends his career with a win.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It's not only Australia who have a player playing his last ODI, New Zealand have too. The bespectacled genius. The left-arm spinner. With boyish looks. <b>Of Italian descent</b>. Harry Potter-esque he resembles they say. Debuted at 18. Battled injuries. Retired. Came back. Trained like hell to be fit for this. To play this World Cup. Was even coach of an Indian T20 League side. Couldn't run on the field. Didn't play for a while. Trained. Trained and trained. For one final appearance in a home World Cup. The name is <b>Daniel Luca Vettori</b>. And he is playing his final game on Sunday.]]></line><line><![CDATA[So Australia have one more reason to be motivated come the day of the final. They would be wanting to do it for Pup. To give him the perfect send-off. With a World Cup win.]]></line><line><![CDATA["I'm extremely thankful and grateful - I've just found out that tomorrow will be my 245th one-day game - it's been an honour and a privilege to represent my country for that amount of games. I'm grateful to every player I have been lucky enough to play with and this team is no exception to that. I think it is the right time for me and the Australian team. I was very fortunate four years ago to get the opportunity to captain this one-day team. That was really good preparation for me leading up to this World Cup, I think the next Australian captain deserves the same opportunity. I don't think it is realistic that I'll be fit and healthy and available to play the next World Cup so I believe it is the right time."]]></line><line><![CDATA["Tomorrow will be my last ODI game for Australia. I've just spoken to my team-mates, spoken to James Sutherland and Rod Marsh and Darren Lehmann and informed them that <b>tomorrow will be my last ODI game for Australia."</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Clarke said that he made the decision after leaving the SCG on Thursday, where Australia beat India in the second semi-final by 95 runs, and told his wife Kyly upon reaching home. He hoped that retiring from ODI cricket would prolong his Test career.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Lots of buildup ahead of the game. Let's focus on that now. 244 games. Debut in 2003. 7907 runs. Average 44.42. Eight hundreds. 57 fifties. One World Cup title. Still in with a chance to make it two. Countless injuries. Taken painkillers to get ready for this tournament. So many fitness issues. He battled them all for this. Just to be ready for the World Cup. The whole country fretted on his fitness. It was front-page news everywhere. Michael Clarke's stats before the big game. But he is giving up the ODI game for good. Why you may ask?]]></line><line><![CDATA[Elliott was the unlikely hero as the devastated South Africans went home. Tears flowed and grown men cried. It was sport at its finest and certainly brought Eden Park to life. The 1992 heartbreak was forgotten and forgiven and the ghosts of that day laid to rest.]]></line><line><![CDATA[McCullum came out a man possessed and proceeded to tear Dale Steyn apart. Steyn went for 25 in one over and New Zealand were flying. Morkel got McCullum out and that brought sanity to the proceedings. There were more twists and turns in the game until Grant Elliott - a South African by birth - nailed the final blow, hitting a six off the penultimate ball to spark unseen scenes at Eden Park.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Semi-final:</b> In the game of the tournament, New Zealand won a cliffhanger against South Africa to move into the final. South Africa were placed for the final assault after 38 overs with AB in a devastating mood. But once again rain came in to spoil their party and the game was reduced to a 43-overs per side match. South Africa made 281 and the D/L adjusted target was 298 for New Zealand.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Quarter-final:</b> Martin Guptill made the highest ever score by a batsman in a World Cup knockout game as his unbeaten 237 powered New Zealand to 393. West Indies went hell for leather and lost by 143 runs. Guptill who was dropped on 4 made the West Indies pay heavily for their mistake as the Wellington crowd were treated to his wide range of strokeplay. With the ball, Boult snared the first four wickets and set his side on their way.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand:</b> New Zealand were the only side apart from India to have a clean slate in the group stages. Played 6. Won 6. Beat Sri Lanka comfortably. Edged past Scotland. Annihilated England. Won a thriller against Australia in the game of the tournament. Eased past Afghanistan and then held their nerve to beat Bangladesh.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Semi-final:</b> Australia faced India and won a crucial toss to bat first. Warner went early but Smith and Finch rebuilt the innings. The former brought up a hundred and continued his tormenting of India. India fought back well after Smith was dismissed but a late cameo from Johnson took Australia to 329. With the runs on the board, the Aussies withstood an initial onslaught from Dhawan before taking wickets at regular intervals. Eventually they reached their seventh World Cup final with a comfortable 95-run win.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Quarter-final:</b> Pakistan were expected to be tricky opposition in the quarters but except for the tremendous spell from Wahab Riaz which had them on the ropes for a while, Australia were always in command. Once they survived Riaz's spell, Australia cantered home to victory to set up a semi-final date with India at the Sydney Cricket Ground.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Road to the final, Australia</b>: Australia began with a bang thumping England. Then there was a washout against Bangladesh before losing a thriller against New Zealand. The no-result and the loss to New Zealand meant they couldn't finish top of the group. Australia smashed Afghanistan then won a high-scoring game against Sri Lanka before having it easy against Scotland.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The MCG has also played host to the 1956 Summer Olympics, the 2006 Commonwealth Games and a few of the FIFA World Cup qualifier games as well.

Even though this entire fiasco took place 34 years back, it galvanised a Trans-Tasman cricket rivalry, which will be at its apex today.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Doing commentary for Channel 9 at that time, <b>Richie Benaud</b>, the legendary Australian captain, described it as disgraceful and one of the worst things that he has seen on the cricket field. To add to that, Ian Chappell, former Australian captain himself and the older brother of Greg and Trevor, was not too pleased with his brother's action either. He was heard saying, <b>"No, Greg, no, you can't do that"</b> in the commentary box.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Greg Chappell's step created a lot of furore and was condemned all over. Bowling underarm was legal at that point of time, but was considered against the spirit of the game. The incident drew widespread criticism from all quarters, including the then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and New Zealand's Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, who described the incident as "the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket".]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Trans-Tasman rivalry took on a whole new meaning after the 1981 Benson and Hedges World Series Cup, third final at the MCG. New Zealand needed 6 off the final ball to tie the game. Trevor Chappell was the bowler. What happened next became one of the biggest controversies in cricket's history. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain and Trevor's older brother, instructs his bowler/brother, to roll the final delivery under-arm.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The term Trans-Tasman is used for the inter-relations between both Australia and New Zealand, since the two countries are geographically separated by the Tasman Sea.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Since Australia and New Zealand are playing, it will only be apt to focus on the Trans-Tasman rivalry a bit. It may not be competing with the likes of India-Pakistan or Australia-England, but the Trans-Tasman rivalry has a history and a past attached to it as well. So, why is it known as the Trans-Tasman rivalry?]]></line><line><![CDATA[Drumroll please! A great day to everyone tuning in here. We welcome you all for one final time in this World Cup.

A country of just 4.5 million. The widely held view and it's a joke - there are more sheep than people in the country. Heck, New Zealand's population is well less than that of Bangalore - a city in India. Still they punch above their weight in every cricketing contest. There was heartbreak in 1992 in front of their own crowd at Eden Park. The time has come to rewrite history. Now is the time.

Australia and New Zealand may get to the park on Sunday with preparation to suggest that they would be approaching their newest battle as just another game. But they need no reminding that this time, unlike in any of their 126 ODI earlier meetings, there is a little reward that awaits the winners – the ICC Cricket World Cup, no less.<br/><br/>On Saturday, the co-hosts prepared for the big day like they would for any other game, not wanting the occasion or the venue to leave them awe-struck. New Zealand paid attention to detail with bowling coach Shane Bond spending time surveying the expansive outfield from a bowler's perspective. Australia turned up in full force on a day of optional practice.<br/><br/>The absence of needle, with the teams not being at loggerheads, and the presence of enormous respect for one another's combative skills should not be misconstrued as a lack of intent on either side. They are both capable of launching spectacular assaults, with their captains unwilling to take their feet off the pedal.<br/><br/>The teams are equally hungry. They are blessed with explosive batsmen and others who can ensure that the power hitters come in at the appropriate times; they have quality fast bowlers and are terrific fielding sides; New Zealand have cricket's shrewdest left-arm spinner, Daniel Vettori to support pace bowlers while Australia rely on Glenn Maxwell to fill up as fifth bowler.<br/><br/>Given that, it will be tempting to sit on the wall and say that the team which plays the better cricket on Sunday will emerge the winner of the World Cup. But while one should not write off McCullum's New Zealand – especially because of his sharp captaincy – they will find it tough to slip past the home team.<br/><br/>Of course, New Zealand are the only unbeaten squad in the World Cup so far, playing an attacking brand of cricket. What's more, they are the only side that has inflicted a defeat on the world's top ODI team in the World Cup, a thrilling one-wicket victory in a Group A league game in Auckland. But that match was all about great bowling, swing, seam and fast.<br/><br/>The MCG deck is the sort which demands great discipline from the batsmen and greater discipline from the bowlers. Australia, who have constantly summoned World Cup winning legends like Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist to chat with the team, can be expected to use their knowledge of MCG to keep their nose ahead of the Black Caps.<br/><br/>New Zealand have not an ODI played in Australia in five years but they will remember that the last time a Black Caps team beat the home side, the game had been played at MCG. As many as seven players in the current squad were part of that team that made light of the fact they were playing on a larger ground than any in their own nation.<br/><br/>Yet, if Australia have been installed as favourites and New Zealand been labelled the underdogs, it is only because the Black Caps have played all their eight World Cup games so far at home. It is the first time they have flown into Australia. How well they adapt to that challenge will determine if they can continue punching like they have done so far.<br/><br/>For all that, if the teams dish out a high quality contest in keeping with the stature of the World Cup final, fans around the globe will add more memories to add to the rich collection from limited-over cricket's biggest event. Australia and New Zealand have the potential to ensure that fans do not remember the game as just another ODI game.<br/><br/><b>Umpires:</b> Kumar Dharmasena (Sri Lanka) and Richard Kettleborough (England). TV umpire: Marais Erasmus (South Africa). Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (Sri Lanka).]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b> (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, George Bailey, Xavier Doherty, Mitchell Marsh]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Tom Latham, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills]]></line>
