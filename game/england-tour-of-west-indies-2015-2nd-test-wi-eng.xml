			<line><![CDATA[So that's it then from us here. England finally win an overseas Test. They will be overjoyed. West Indies have some work to do before the next one in Barbados on May 1st. That should be a pacy pitch and a result-oriented one (hopefully). We enjoyed bringing you this game. Hope you did too, reading our coverage of it. Cricket continues on, there is the IPL which is going on. So do join us tomorrow to follow all that. Until then it is goodbye from us. Remember to be well and take care. Also to sleep tight. Alvida!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Cook:</b> 'The most important thing was an England win. To get 20 wickets on such a flat wicket was a great effort. Lot of skill involved. To get six wickets in that morning session really set us up. It was all about putting the ball in the right area with the right intensity. Credit to Jimmy, what an outstanding spell that was, don't know whether it was 8 or 9 overs in that heat - it was a testament to his skill and his fitness. Can't fault the lads at all today and over the five days. Fantastic from Rooty and Gary. I didn't realise his record was so good for the last 15 months or so (talking about Root). They (Root and Gary) have taken run making to a new level for England. I dropped Samuels on 30. It was costly, he played really well. They probably got 50 too many in the conditions that we had in our favor. At the end of the day we got 470 and bowled them out for 300. That set the game up for us there. The lads were brilliant. The wickets we have played on in the first two Tests have been very slow and hard to force a result. It has been a hell of a lot of hard work for the last 10 days and we got the reward today. Thanks to the Barmy Army, the hotels are full at the minute and also for our families who have been here. We love playing for England and we are doing it in front of them as well - it is brilliant.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ramdin:</b> 'We fought hard for the first four days but that one session where we lost 6 wickets really cost us the game. I'm not quite sure, when you have teams in a position where you can win or draw you should take the initiative. But that spell from Anderson in the morning took it away from us. The batters who got in need to carry on. It is difficult for a new batsman to go in and face the new ball. But that's how it goes. The England team stuck at it, they went out there and executed their plans. It was tough conditions to go out there and play our strokes. As the game went along the pitch got better for them. Slight injury to Holder, hopefully he will rest and get back out strong for the next game.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Root:</b> 'Feels a lot better now with the win behind us. Last night and throughout today we have been ruthless and it is great to take something forward into the summer. Just wanted to be busy from the off and tried to make it hard for the guys to bowl at me early on in my innings. It got me going anyway. Lot of credit has to go to the way the openers played. There are so many positives to take out for our side from this game and we are chomped at the bits to get back out there at Barbados. Probably being left out. That's the worst thing I had to deal with in cricket - Cookie coming up to me and telling me that I was not playing. Never want to be in that position again. So get greedy and get whatever runs I can.  Something that Graham Gooch told us when I came into the team - to get daddy hundreds. Something we all aspire to do in the dressing room and something we would look to do in the summer. No, not really. Part of the game I'm afraid. Being involved in three other run outs and called a former Yorkshire and England batsman - we will see how things go.' (in response to Athers' question on whether he had a word with Anderson after that run out)]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Joe Root is the Man of the Match</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[England had a session and a half to get to the target of 143 and they did so without much fuss. Cook and Ballance brought up their second fifties on the trot and scored at a good rate to help the hosts over the line comfortably in the end. The visitors won the second Test by nine wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, which ensured the retention of the Wisden Trophy.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Kraigg Brathwaite scored a fine century on day 4 and was supported well by Darren Bravo and Marlon Samuels as they frustrated the England bowlers, who struggled on a slow and flat track. However, James Anderson's inspired spell on the final day helped England bowl out West Indies for 307 just after lunch. Anderson finished with 4/43 which included three scalps on day 5 while he also took two catches and effected a run out.]]></line><line><![CDATA[In reply, England were slow but steady with Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott registering patient half-centuries and bringing up their maiden century stand for the opening wicket. Gary Ballance too shone in the first essay with a knock of 77, but it was Joe Root who was the best of the lot as he came up with terrific 182. He was unfortunate to miss out on a double hundred, running out of partners to be stranded when England were bowled out for 464, finishing with a 165-run lead. Bishoo, playing his first Test in three years, picked up a four-wicket haul.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Match recap:</b> West Indies did not get off to the best of starts after being inserted on day one, and were put on the back foot straightaway as they suffered a top-order collapse. On the rain-curtailed opening day, England were calling all the shots until Marlon Samuels bailed the hosts out of trouble. Rain made Samuels wait for a while on day 2 before he went on to register his seventh Test ton. However a loss in concentration resulted in his dismissal while the middle order batsmen failed to come up with anything substantial and England were back on top again. However, the visitors took a while to separate the last wicket pair of Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel, who added 52 runs to take West Indies to one short of 300. Stuart Broad was the top wicket-taker for England in the first innings, finishing with 4/61.]]></line><line><![CDATA[From that point on the result was a mere formality and England duly completed proceedings to win. Runs for Ballance and Cook and that should please the English set-up. Also winning an overseas Test after 10 attempts will bring cheer to their camp. West Indies saved the game in Antigua but a poor morning session here has seen them go 0-1 down in the series. We will have the match summary first and then the presentation to follow. Do stay tuned...]]></line><line><![CDATA[Handshakes all around. Smiles in the England camp. Anderson the man of the moment walks out and hugs Ballance and Cook. <b>Stokes salutes to Ottis Gibson in celebration</b>. That was Stokes taking the mickey out of Samuels. West Indies fought hard for four days but one bad session today cost the game. They came apart against one man - Anderson in particular who had a hand in all the six dismissals in the morning session]]></line><line><![CDATA[41.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels to Ballance, <b>FOUR</b>, <b>England win!</b> Ballance and Cook punch the air in delight. <b>First overseas win for them since December 2012 when they beat India at Kolkata.</b> Short and wide outside off, Ballance cuts late and beats point diving to his right. The ball races away. Ballance and Cook grab stumps as souvenirs and walk off. Well done!]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[40.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraigg Brathwaite to Cook, no run, flighted delivery outside off, pushed to cover off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraigg Brathwaite to Cook, no run, flat on the stumps, defended back to the bowler]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraigg Brathwaite to Ballance, 1 run, short and wide outside off, cut square of the wicket, for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[Still Bravo going on about something]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraigg Brathwaite to Ballance, 2 runs, tossed up outside off, driven through cover who gets a bad bounce and gives away two]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraigg Brathwaite to Ballance, no run, Ballance goes on the back foot to block]]></line><line><![CDATA[40.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraigg Brathwaite to Ballance, no run, well outside off, Ballance leaves]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[England just one hit away from going 1-0 up.

Stay tuned.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England might have just picked up two wickets yesterday, but it's a new day today. If they can pick a few early wickets today, they will put the men from Caribbean under pressure. At the same time, a West Indian win looks very unlikely with the current scenario. If they are to win this game, they will have to bat remarkably well and score really quickly. In addition to that, they will have to take 10 English wickets and all this looks a fair way away from the position they are in right now.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to the fifth and final day of the second Test between West Indies and England. The game might be headed for a draw, but there's no shortage of excitement. Riding on Brathwaite's ton yesterday, West Indies managed to go past England's lead. Currently, the West Indians are ahead by 37 runs, with Brathwaite and Samuels at the crease.]]></line><line><![CDATA[This Test looks headed towards a draw. But England will have a new cherry in five overs time. One final effort with that and if they get quick wickets, they might still win the game. For that to happen the pitch has to aid them as well. West Indies would be looking to bat on and make the game safe. It sets up a beautiful final day. We will be there to bring you all the action. Hope you've enjoyed today's coverage. Until tomorrow it's goodbye from here. Sleep tight! Adios!]]></line><line><![CDATA[They tried to get Kraigg Brathwaite and Samuels out with the leg-trap late on asking Jordan and Anderson to target the stumps. Jordan reversed it and caused uncomfortable situations for the batsmen during that phase, but the West Indian pair held on. Off the penultimate over of the day, Brathwaite got his fourth Test ton. The one battle that everyone expected to see today between Samuels and Stokes proved to be an anti-climax as Stokes kept quiet. Unusually calm and subdued. As was Samuels. Maybe we might see something rev up tomorrow.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, England in search of quick runs went after the bowling and lost wickets. Root tried to reach his maiden double hundred but sloppy running from Anderson put paid to that. The lead was 165 and they got Devon Smith out early. But since then Kraigg Brathwaite has stood firm, first building a partnership with Darren Bravo and then with Samuels. The pitch was flat and England's bowlers toiled hard without any significant reward.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Stokes comes in and shakes Kraigg Brathwaite's hand. Moeen Ali pats the young man. Phil Simmons looks a pleased man. The day has belonged to the 22-year old opener from Barbados - Kraigg Brathwaite.

Root's unbeaten hundred was the highlight of yesterday's play. But the last hour belonged to West Indies helped by England's bad cricket. Three wickets were gifted to the hosts and Samuels gave Stokes a send-off by saluting. It was brilliant from the Jamaican as he brought life late on to the day's proceedings. Those three wickets have given West Indies hope of keeping the lead to manageable proportions.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It has been a long day but a fun day - made all the more enjoyable by Samuels' theatre.

Until tomorrow it's goodbye from here. Adios!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Amidst all this Root deserves special praise for the way he conducted his innings. He was calm, played all his strokes and put the bad ball away. Unfluttered and very impressive from the Yorkshireman who continued his golden run with the bat. He hardly gave West Indies a chance and remains the key for England to gain a potentially match-winning first innings lead. West Indies will be looking to get his wicket as quickly as possible tomorrow morning.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England steadily built on their lead and only the last hour brought West Indies back into the game. England though had a huge part in that, gifting three wickets to the hosts. Ballance played a loose drive, Moeen Ali ran himself out and Stokes holed out after losing the verbal battle with Samuels. The battle between Samuels and Stokes was the highlight of the day. The Jamaican seemed inspired when Stokes came on and didn't stop his antics till the all-rounder got out. No aggressive in your face celebration or anything nasty. Just a salute with no words after Stokes got out! Pure gold from Samuels! Superb drama to liven up things.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Root walks off with his bat raised. Darren Bravo comes in and shakes his hand. Samuels has a smile on his face after a hard day's work. England started the day at 74/0 and they lost Trott before lunch. Cook was set to get a hundred but chopped one off Gabriel who dismissed Ian Bell the same way in his next over. Those two wickets in quick succession energised West Indies but Root and Ballance put on a partnership. Slightly bizzare tactics by West Indies as they overbowled Bishoo - who bowled 22 overs at one stretch either side of lunch. Also West Indies didn't take the new ball till the 87th over when it was crying out to be taken.]]></line><line><![CDATA[123.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels to Buttler, no run, Buttler sees off the day without any issues.

Root then upped the ante and recorded his 6th successive 50-plus score in Tests. It was also surprising to see that West Indies did not opt for the second new ball straightaway.

I have great news for you folks. Unlike the first two days, it is bright and sunny at the ground and we will have a prompt start.

However, he threw it away soon after. With West Indies losing 4 wickets for 24 runs, things looked very bad, but a handy fifty partnership between Bishoo and Gabriel for the last wicket helped West Indies post 299. Stuart Broad was the pick of the bowlers for England today and he finished with 4 wickets. James Anderson and Chris Jordan bagged two wickets apiece.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stumps, Day 2</b>: Having bowled West Indies out for 299, England have made a solid start in their first innings. The hosts missed Jerome Taylor badly as both Kemar Roach and Shannon Gabriel failed to trouble Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott with the new ball. Although Devendra Bishoo bowled well, both the England batsmen played him confidently to give the visitors the advantage at this stage of the match. In the process, Cook also surpassed Alec Stewart (8463) to become England's second highest run-getter in Tests.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Both umpires converge and check the light again.

Marlon Samuels has held this West Indies innings together in tough conditions. He is now on the verge of recording his 7th hundred in Tests. Captain Denesh Ramdin gave him good company yesterday before play was stopped due to bad light. However, both will have to start afresh today and West Indies need them to get a big partnership. Life is certainly not going to be easy for them though. After a night's rest, the England bowlers will be fresh and there will be some swing on offer early in the morning.]]></line><line><![CDATA[That's it from us. Play will begin 15 minutes early tomorrow, at <b>09:45 local time</b>. Looking forward to your company then. Goodbye!]]></line><line><![CDATA[With Shivnarine Chanderpaul too gifting his wicket away to Ben Stokes soon after, West Indies found themselves in deep trouble, but Jermaine Blackwood and Marlon Samuels survived a few close calls and registered a fifty partnership before England and Jordan successfully reviewed an LBW shout to dismiss the former. A while later, after Samuels crossed fifty, England, Stokes in particular, sledged Samuels and that got Samuels going as he batted aggressively and took the attack to England. Soon Samuels recorded a fifty partnership with skipper Denesh Ramdin. With light fading quickly, the umpires ruled that only spinners can be employed but England were reluctant to bowl spin at both ends. Hence, play could not carry on further.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stumps, Day 1</b>: Play began after a 105-minute rain delay. In overcast conditions, James Anderson bowled a big inswinger to knock over Kraigg Brathwaite. With Stuart Broad not bowling a consistent line, Alastair Cook introduced Chris Jordan into the attack. Jordan had Devon Smith dropped by Gary Ballance at leg slip, but he removed Smith in the same over. However, replays suggested that Smith had not edged the ball. Smith opted not to review because the bat hit the ground at the same time the ball passed the bat and he was not confident that he did not edge it. Just when Darren Bravo looked set for a big knock, he poked a Broad delivery to Cook at slip and threw his wicket away.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The players are leaving the field. Umpire Steve Davis takes the bails off. Looks like England didn't want to operate with spinners. Marlon Samuels walks off the field and hits the boundary cushions with his bat.

Ian Bell proved why he's the best batsman in this current England line-up with a gritty 143 in the first innings. In reply, when West Indies were in deep trouble 23-year-old Jermaine Blackwood fought hard and bailed the side of trouble by registering his maiden Test hundred. Gary Ballance then scored a fine hundred in the third innings of the game to bat West Indies out of the match. West Indies' ODI captain, Jason Holder, showed his class with the bat by scoring a brisk hundred under immense pressure when the England bowlers had their tails up.]]></line><line><![CDATA[James Anderson, one of the best fast bowlers around, had a memorable game in Antigua. In the second innings, when he found the outside of Denesh Ramdin, he surpassed Ian Botham to become England's highest wicket-taker in Tests. A few members of Anderson's family also celebrated the moment from the stands as the England players congratulated their hero on the field.]]></line><line><![CDATA[After an exciting draw in Antigua, the action now shifts to Grenada for the second game of this 3-match Test series. There was a light shower in the morning but the good news is that the rain has stopped and made way some bright sunshine. The covers have also been removed. Because of overnight rain, there could be a bit of moisture on the surface and it looks like there is a bit of grass cover as well. It is quite humid out there, which means there will be some swing on offer early on. So, like the first Test, will teams opt to field first? Let's wait and see. For now, let's look back at the first game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b><br/><br/>After a Jason Holder-inspired thrilling draw in the first Test, West Indies and England will square off once again at the National Cricket Stadium at St George's, Grenada. Both teams had a few positives and an equal measure of negatives in the first Test. While West Indies will be looking to maintain their intensity over longer periods of play, England will be striving towards being more dominant.<br/><br/>Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Jermaine Blackwood and Holder all scored tons but it was only England who looked like winning the Test. That West Indies managed to stave off defeat would give them a moral high but newer tests beckon both teams on Tuesday.<br/><br/>Venue: National Cricket Stadium, St George's, Grenada<br/><br/>Date: April 21, 2015 - Apr 25, 2015<br/><br/>Time: 1400 GMT<br/><br/>Team news<br/><br/>West Indies<br/><br/>Denesh Ramdin's team chartered a jailbreak in Antigua but they will know that only a much-improved performance would give them a chance of winning the series. Blackwood was a revelation for them in the first innings of that Test but the batting does look brittle without support. Partnerships will be the key and that is something the hosts will be keen to improve upon.<br/><br/>It helped matters that Ramdin himself stepped up on the last day to assist Holder in a key stand. The skipper has set the bar high and will expect his mates to follow suit. The heartening fact in the batting would be the form shown by the youngsters Devon Smith, Blackwood and Holder. The more experienced campaigners like Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Marlon Samuels and Darren Bravo will be expected to play to their potential. That does give the batting a solid look.<br/><br/>Kemar Roach was the standout performer with the ball in the first Test. In both innings he led the way and set the tone after early strikes by Jerome Taylor. Both of them were well backed up by Holder but Suleiman Benn was a disappointment, and as a result he has been dropped from the squad, which leaves Devendra Bishoo as the only specialist spinner. The pacers will be expected to hold their places.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Kraigg Brathwaite, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Marlon Samuels, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Jermaine Blackwood, 7 Denesh Ramdin (capt/wk), 8 Jason Holder, 9 Kemar Roach, 10 Jerome Taylor, 11 Devendra Bishoo<br/><br/>England<br/><br/>Inarguably, Alastair Cook's men were better for a major part of the first Test but it is also inescapable that they failed to finish the Test. Just a three-day layover could prove difficult to overcome the disappointment of not going 1-0 up in the three-match series. However, the challenge will be to shake it off and start the process all over again. The opening pair of Cook and Jonathan Trott did not do anything of notice in the first Test. However, given their experience, the duo will get another shot at Grenada. It also helps their cause that Ballance, Joe Root, Bell, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler all scored at least a fifty in Antigua. That largely overshadowed the brittleness at the top and England will be looking forward for the experienced duo to pull their weight as well.<br/><br/>James Anderson, who became England's all-time highest leading wicket-taker in Antigua, will no doubt be buoyed and even more confident of leading the attack. The pace trio of Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Jordan did a commendable job but it was James Tredwell who stole the show. The offspinner's consistent show and the added advantage of Root's part-time spin gives Cook enough depth. Their lack of penetration in the crucial second innings was largely due to good batting on a pretty lifeless pitch. Cook will be placing faith on the same men to come good in Grenada.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Alastair Cook (capt), 2 Jonathan Trott, 3 Gary Ballance, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Joe Root, 6 Ben Stokes, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 James Tredwell, 11 James Anderson<br/><br/>Stats and Trivia<br/><br/>Only two Tests have been played in the National Cricket Stadium before, the last of which was in 2009. West Indies drew one game and lost the next against Bangladesh in 2009.<br/><br/>Quotes<br/><br/>"There's talk of there being a bit more bounce here than in Antigua. West Indies swung the new ball nicely in both innings - so we have to use the new ball well and get a few wickets early - and we're going to have to change our plans, get a lot of men in front of the bat." - England's new vice-captainIan Bell discusses strategy]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England</b> (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Adam Lyth, Jonathan Bairstow, Liam Plunkett, Mark Wood, Adil Rashid, James Tredwell]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>West Indies</b> (From): Kraigg Brathwaite, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Jermaine Blackwood, Denesh Ramdin(c/w), Jason Holder, Kemar Roach, Jerome Taylor, Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo, Carlos Brathwaite, Shai Hope]]></line>
