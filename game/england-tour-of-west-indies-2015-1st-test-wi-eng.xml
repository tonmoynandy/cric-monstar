When England came out Trott and Cook both flopped once again falling to Jerome Taylor. Bell was run out soon after leaving his side at 52/3.

England lead by 220 and would be looking towards a declaration sometime around tea today]]></line><line><![CDATA[Jermaine Blackwood showed he is a player of immense potential and one that West Indies can bank on in the future.

Then as it happened so often in the past, the West Indies tail folded quickly leaving the young man stranded. A lead of 104 - a precious one - was garnered by England.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Jermaine Blackwood's maiden Test ton was definitely the highlight of day 3. The youngster showed remarkable resilience to remain unbeaten till the end and keep England's lead to 104. It was a shame that he did not receive adequate support from the other end. James Tredwell proved the unlikely strike force as he bagged a four-wicket haul including that of the dangerous Chanderpaul. Jerome Taylor gave England some early jitters with the wickets of Trott and Cook but England fought back steadily after that. Ian Bell fell cheaply as well but Ballance and Root have ensured that England finished the day well on top. West Indies need to restrict England quickly tomorrow but that will be a very tough task. Join us again tomorrow to see how they fare. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[37.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels to Ballance, 1 run, full delivery outside off, Ballance leans forward and drives it to sweeper cover.

So let's see whether things move at pace or will it be another slow day like yesterday. Blackwood has looked good, apart from the solitary occasion when he edged a catch to slip. But that turned out to be a no-ball and he was reprieved. Chanders is looking as solid as ever at the other end. England toiled hard but didn't get much assistance from the pitch. Will it be any different today? Stay tuned to find out...]]></line><line><![CDATA[It was West Indies' day yesterday. First they replicated the success of the first day's opening session with the ball - bowling tight lines, being disciplined and then playing on the batsmen's patience. They were rewarded with the last five wickets for just 58 runs as England were bowled out for 399. Then they came out with the bat and even though they have lost four wickets, the partnership between Chanderpaul and Blackwood has raised hopes of matching England's total.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Another attritional day of Test cricket at the end of which England are ahead when the bigger picture is viewed but West Indies are not out of it yet. Not as long as Chanderpaul is out there fighting. Jermaine Blackwood too has shown enough promise and stomach for a fight. The duo added 56 runs in the final session after England removed two well set batsmen - Brathwaite and Samuels - early in the last session. West Indies' bowlers did well to restrict England to 399 in the first session of the day. The reply started steadily but suffered a wobble in the middle. That has been culled for the time being but they are still 244 adrift at the end of day 2. A good contest between bat and ball in the offing on day 3. Do join us again for all the action.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It will be <b>stumps</b> on day 2]]></line><line><![CDATA[65.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tredwell to Chanderpaul, no run, that will be that!

Jerome Taylor got the crucial first breakthrough early in the day when he got a well set Ben Stokes for 79.

England finished just one short of 400, a pleasing session for the WI bowlers but the batsmen need to back it up now. It won't be easy in conditions that are helping the seamers.

Runs flowed from Bell and Stokes with the former notching up his 22nd Test hundred. Stokes supported Bell well with an attacking fifty of his own.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Day 1 was a tale of two different sessions. West Indies were outstanding in the morning session when they scalped three wickets and bowled with relentless control and precision. There was hardly a bad ball as Taylor, Roach and Holder probed away on or around off. Intense pressure was built up on the batsmen and England were three down at lunch.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Ian Bell's fantastic 143 scuttled all the good work done by West Indies in the first session. They were 49/3 at lunch but England fought back through a 177-run stand between Bell and Root. The former scored his 22nd Test ton and gave a masterclass in turning things around through some old-fashioned albeit clinical batting. He dug in when the pacers were bowling well and cashed in when they tired. Root gave him excellent support in the second session as West Indies fell apart. Kemar Roach was the standout bowler and he proved it once again with a stunning ball late in the day to bag Bell. West Indies were superb with the new ball in the morning but leaked quick runs with the second new ball. Ben Stokes stroked a free-flowing fifty in the last session as England completed the turnaround by scoring 174 runs. The wicket of Bell must boost West Indies but they still have a lot of work to do tomorrow to prevent a tall first innings score. Thanks for joining us today. Do come back again tomorrow to catch all the action.]]></line><line><![CDATA[That will be <b>stumps</b> on day 1. Root is all smiles in the dressing room.

Should be another gripping session. Let's see whether West Indies can continue their good work.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It has been a near perfect exhibition of top class fast bowling from West Indies in the first session. Jerome Taylor got the early breakthrough when he stunted Trott's comeback and sent him back for a duck. Kemar Roach then took over the mantle of creating pressure under overcast conditions. Cook was castled for 11 by the leader of the pace attack. Jason Holder kept up the pressure coming in as first change and reaped Ballance's wicket after Roach built up pressure at the other end. A very brief shower interrupted the game but not much time was lost. The pacers continued to exploit the juice in the track to keep England on the mat. Joe Root and Ian Bell had no option but to try and survive. Run-scoring probably did not even cross their mind and neither was it allowed to by West Indies. That explains the scoreline at lunch. England crawling at a run-rate around two per over and battling for survival. All West Indies at the moment and England need to dig deep to fashion a comeback today. If West Indies can maintain the same intensity in the next two sessions, it will make for fascinating viewing. Stay tuned. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>That will be lunch on day 1</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[24.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Holder to Bell, no run, a fine maiden to end the session.

A poignant moment!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Cook:</b> "We are going to have a bat first. If we can get through the first session, should be a good wicket to bat on. Trott comes in to open and Stokes at 6. We have gone for Tredders, he has waited a long time and he has done very well so far on the tour. It is great to have him and it is an amazing effort to come back from where he was in Brisbane and hope he does well this week (on Trott). Incredible effort, he is the most skilful bowler I have seen. That alongside his work ethic and work hard as he does, hopefully we can make it special for him this week as well (on Anderson)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ramdin:</b> "We are going to have a bowl first. We want to exploit the moisture early on. Hopefully our new ball bowlers will get some assistance and get a few top order wickets and put the middle order under pressure. Not on this, no (when asked if they thought about playing two spinners on this). Phil Simmons has been motivating us to win Test matches."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pitch report:</b> The last time these two sides met in this venue the game lasted 10 balls and just 34 minutes.

However, they've lost just one series in the last 47 years against England at home. They won 1-0 when England toured in 2009.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Weather update:</b> A high of 28 degree celsius is predicted. The weather department says that there is a 80% chance of rain.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England:</b> The question doing the rounds is whether England will go with Trott to open or give the left-handed Yorkshireman Adam Lyth his debut. Lyth had a tremendous county season last year so it will be an interesting decision. Ben Stokes will be in at 6 replacing the injured Moeen Ali. James Tredwell may get the nod over Adil Rashid for the lone spinning spot.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pre-match</b> team news, <b>West Indies</b>: Legspinner Devendra Bishoo makes a comeback into the West Indies side after three years while the selectors have also named uncapped wicketkeeper-batsman Shai Hope and fast bowler Carlos Brathwaite in the 14-man squad. There is no Chris Gayle which means Devon Smith will open. Darren Bravo who was injured during the World Cup is back as well. It is a battle for the 6 spot between Blackwood and the newcomer Shai Hope. Also it will be interesting to see whether West Indies go in with two spinners or three quicks.]]></line><line><![CDATA[West Indies' captain <b>Denesh Ramdin</b> feels that Chanderpaul's experience in constructing long innings would be crucial to West Indies putting up big scores in the three-match series. "His (Chanderpaul's) experience is second to none, especially with all those matches he has played at international level," Ramdin said. "I'm sure he will go on to get the most runs for West Indies as a Test player and I'm sure that's his goal but with with his experience in the middle order, batting all those balls, we need other guys to bat with him to get partnerships and get big totals so we have opportunities to win matches."]]></line><line><![CDATA["But it's something special to coach your own country. And once we get to that level of doing everything professionally I think the talent will come through."]]></line><line><![CDATA["I know we're not in the best of places right now."]]></line><line><![CDATA["It's been frustrating [to witness West Indies' decline]. It would be for anyone who has represented West Indies. It's been disappointing to see the way we've played."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let us now focus on the new West Indian coach, Phil Simmons, a bit. After coaching Ireland for eight years, Simmons took up the West Indian role just before this series. He is of the opinion that only through hard work can the West Indies rise from their position as No. 8 rated Test team to a place in the top three. "It's been well documented that we're not in a good place as far as cricket is concerned," Simmons admitted to ESPNCricinfo. "We need to get back in that good place."]]></line><line><![CDATA["You have got to keep things in perspective and you've got to understand that there are no guarantees in life. Things aren't just going to work out your way and you've just got to roll with the punches sometimes. Being better at that is something I feel that I have and I've worked really hard at a few things, a culmination of things had to come together for me to be able to get here. I'm really pleased."]]></line><line><![CDATA[The 33-year old is not content, however, by just making the England squad. He now wants to contribute towards Test match wins. "It's not all about high fives and handshakes. It's about doing some hard yards and winning Test matches for England.]]></line><line><![CDATA["It feels very nice. It's a culmination of a lot of hard work for a couple of months with the (England) Lions and with Warwickshire," Trott told ecb.co.uk. "It's always pleasing to get the opportunity to come back and play for England, it's something I've worked really hard for. It's nice to be here, but the hard work continues and trying to prepare and earn a place in the Test team."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Another man who will have attention focussed upon him will be Jonathan Trott. The right-handed batsman, who infamously pulled out midway through the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia due to a stress-related illness, is making his comeback in this series. It has been a tough 15 months for the Warwickshire batsman but he is looking forward to put that behind him.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Despite his great success, Anderson believes he may not be the bowler he was before getting charged with a Level 3 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct after his alleged shoving incident with India's Ravindra Jadeja. "I've definitely been different since that incident," Anderson told ESPNCricinfo. "It probably affected me during the World Cup. "It didn't affect me during that India series because there was still that real determination to win; I was aggressive without being over the top. But in the World Cup, there was a constant sense that the ICC were watching," he said.]]></line><line><![CDATA["We want to express ourselves and put smiles back on people's faces," Anderson told <b>BBC Sport</b>. "The 100th Test is a huge landmark for a player. I'm really looking forward to experiencing it. But the record will take a back seat. We have a really important period ahead trying to get some wins and get some form after a disappointing winter, so concentrating on that is the most important thing. It's a huge Test match for us as a team. We've got a lot of hard work to do out here, we know it is going to be tough, but we're really excited about the challenge."]]></line><line><![CDATA[He may have lost a bit of pace but makes it up with his potent swinging pedigree. When the ball swings, he along with Dale Steyn are the two best exponents of the art of swing bowling. Anderson will become the 12th Englishman to play 100 Tests, but said that he would like to put his personal achievements behind and concentrate on putting 'the smile back on people's faces' after a poor season.]]></line><line><![CDATA[One man though who will be the cynosure of all eyes will be James Anderson. This Test will be Anderson's 100th match and  he's also just four wickets short of beating Ian Botham's record tally of 383 Test wickets for England. Anderson has come a long way from the blonde-haired kid who tore Pakistan apart in the 2003 World Cup. Since then his career has seen many ups and downs but over the last few years, he has been England's premier fast bowler and the leader of the pack.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England though won the last Test series they played, against India and their captain Alastair Cook desperately needs to fire. He is under a lot of pressure coming into this series having not made a Test ton for the last 31 innings. His last hundred came against New Zealand in May 2013 at Leeds. If he fails to get runs this series, then several more questions will be asked not only of his captaincy but also of his batting spot.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Both sides are coming on the back of poor results currently. England had a shocking World Cup where they failed to reach the quarter-finals losing to Bangladesh and getting knocked out. Alastair Cook wasn't a part of that campaign but still the appointment of Eoin Morgan didn't make any difference to their World Cup hopes. A lot of ink has been spent analysing, dissecting and understanding where England have gone wrong. The criticism some times went overboard but that's how it is in England. West Indies reached the quarters but they were thrashed by New Zealand in that game. On current form it is a battle between two teams trying hard to regain their lost glory.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>08:53 Local Time, 12:53 GMT, 18:23 IST:</b> It is back to whites and red ball cricket! Test Cricket is back after a flurry of short format cricket. It is West Indies v England and it is kicking off at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. England are playing a Test match after a gap of nearly 8 months. In that period they have played 25 ODIs if you include the two World Cup warm-up games as well. West Indies on the other hand faced South Africa in a Test series in January.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b><br/>The World Cup hangover has hardly come down but the bandwagon rolls on as West Indies and England prepare to lock horns in another format while also tackling a host of internal problems. England will have to look past their horrendous World Cup campaign, sweeping changes in the ECB and tide past the varied issues that accompany it.<br/><br/>West Indies have for long been tussling with players drifting away from the longest format and a wide variety of administrative problems of their own. Denesh Ramdin's men will have to put all that behind when they walk out for the first of the two Tests at Antigua.<br/><br/>West Indies have won just two Tests out of their last 27 meetings against England. However, they've lost just one series in the last 47 years against England at home. They won 1-0 when England toured in 2009 but Ramdin's current side bears a pale resemblance to the side which won six years ago. England are ranked third in the ICC Test rankings and won their last Test series against India quite comprehensively. That will count for little now as a lot of water has passed under the bridge since July 2014.<br/><br/>Venue: Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua<br/><br/>Date: April 13, 2015<br/><br/>Time: 1400 GMT<br/><br/>Team news:<br/><br/>England<br/><br/>This will be James Anderson's 100th Test and he's also just four wickets short of beating Ian Botham's record tally of 383 Test wickets for England. The leader of the pace attack will be keen to make a mark on this special occasion and it's a testimony to his excellence over the years that he still remains England's premier bowler. He's formed a potent combination with Stuart Broad and the duo's form will be key to England's success in the Caribbean. The wrist spin of Adil Rashid is likely to be preferred over James Tredwell's offspin with the pitch likely to being on the slower side.<br/><br/>Selecting the right batsmen will pose more problems for the England think tank. Jonathan Trott is back in the squad after battling mental fatigue during the 2013/14 Ashes in Australia but did not make a pressing case for immediate selection in the two practice games ahead of the first Test. England's practice games were shambolic with the the players joining in with the St Kitts XI to try and make for competitive match practice. Trott's 72 in the tour opener at St Kitts looks to have tilted the scales in his favour over the uncapped Adam Lyth, meaning that he and Alastair Cook - who has not scored a century in 31 Test innings - could be the openers.<br/><br/>Probable XI<br/><br/>1 Alastair Cook (capt), 2 Jonathan Trott/Adam Lyth, 3 Gary Ballance, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Joe Root, 6 Jonathan Bairstow, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 James Anderson, 11 Adil Rashid<br/><br/>West Indies<br/><br/>Phil Simmons' first assignment as head coach of West Indies will not be an easy one. He's had a lot of success with Ireland but his home side are currently placed eighth in the Test rankings and pushing them up will be top priority. Ramdin has a lot of responsibility to shoulder and will be banking on the experience of Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Marlon Samuels to lead the way with the batting. In Darren Bravo, they have a youngster with immense potential and the rest of the batting unit will be focussing on batting around these three.<br/><br/>Kemar Roach has been West Indies' most successful bowler in recent years and remains a pacer who can produce a match-turning spell. Carlos Brathwaite, the uncapped pacer, is likely to be picked ahead of Jerome Taylor given his form recently while Jason Holder will fill in the role of the third seamer. Devendra Bishoo has been brought into the side after three years and is likely to get the nod ahead of Suleiman Benn who had a lacklustre series against South Africa late last year.<br/><br/>Probable XI<br/><br/>1 Kraigg Brathwaite, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Marlon Samuels, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 6 Jermaine Blackwood, 7 Denesh Ramdin (capt/wk), 8 Jason Holder, 9 Kemar Roach, 10 Devendra Bishoo, 11 Carlos Brathwaite]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England</b> (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Chris Jordan, Adam Lyth, Jonathan Bairstow, Mark Wood, James Tredwell]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>West Indies</b> (From): Kraigg Brathwaite, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Denesh Ramdin(c/w), Jermaine Blackwood, Jerome Taylor, Sulieman Benn, Kemar Roach, Carlos Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jason Holder, Shai Hope]]></line>
