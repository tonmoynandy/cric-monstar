			<line><![CDATA[It's Australia v New Zealand at the MCG on Sunday. Wow! What a cracking game that will be. Two best teams on display in the final and you wouldn't want to miss a single ball. McCullum v Starc/Johnson, Warner v Boult/Southee. Ah! I can't wait for the action to begin. We will start proceedings nice and early. Looking forward to your company then. Goodbye!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Although India lost the game, their fans can still be proud of the way they played in this tournament. After the tri-series, there were serious doubts about India's performance in the World Cup but MS Dhoni and the entire team have done extremely well to stick together as a unit and stunned everyone by playing some excellent cricket. Barring this game, in the batting department, each player has taken responsibility when needed, while the bowlers were simply outstanding. In fact, India's pace attack was rated as one of the best in the competition and they bowled out their opponents in seven successive games. The fielding has been generally very good as well. Overall, they played some good cricket, but it is just that they weren't good enough on the day. Congratulations to Australia, who were the better team on the day. The batsmen hung in there when the ball was doing its bit and the bowlers came back strongly despite India getting off to a good start.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at some of the best <b>tweets</b> that pertain to this game:]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@sachin_rt:</b> Well played in the ICC World Cup Team India. A tough game today and a loss is always difficult to handle. But you have played some terrific cricket throughout and all the fans have enjoyed watching you.

Then a wicket. Then steady. Then 9th over: double wicket maiden.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA["We are really proud to be able to make it to the final. We know it's going to be tough against New Zealand. I think for us, it's only a couple of days. It will be about recovery. I think we'll fly to Melbourne tomorrow morning. We'll recover in the afternoon and obviously speak to the coach and see what we have to do for training on Saturday. But I think the priority is to make sure that we recover. It's been a long summer for a lot of the guys. They've got plenty of cricket under their belt. Mentally, I think they are ready to go, ready to walk into the final, but physically we have got a couple of days to make sure that we are right. Brendon (McCullum) has done a fantastic job there as well. I think they are playing some great cricket. We have to be at our best. We said that before tonight's game. India are always a tough opposition. We have to play our best to beat these great teams and the final will be no different. I look forward to it (the final). It's always great to play against New Zealand. I hope so many Aussies can come out and support us. We always love the support and it goes a long way. It has helped us get this far in the tournament. I am sure the final will be no different."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Clarke</b>: "Obviously really excited. Obviously the guys have played some outstanding cricket. Smithy (Steven Smith) was exceptional once again. Jeez! He's hitting the ball so sweetly and I was really proud of the execution under pressure from our bowlers. Credit needs to go to all the players. I think everybody has chipped in today. Once again a lot of guys sacrificed themselves for the team. A huge congratulations and thanks to MS Dhoni and the Indian team for like you said, it's been a long summer. I think they have competed really well and shown their talent throughout this tournament. I heard you ask him (Dhoni) if it was his last World Cup. I am pretty sure it's not going to be. He's got a lot of cricket left in him. We have been playing some really good cricket at the moment. Losing to New Zealand gave us that kick up our back side. We worked on the areas we needed to. The most pleasing thing for me is the way we have trained. Our preparation has been outstanding. The boys have turned up for training every single day to try and become better and I think our results have shown that. I still don't think we've played the perfect game yet, we've improved every game and now we are excited to be in the final. It's a wonderful achievement."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Clarke shakes hands with Dhoni before coming on to talk.]]></line><line><![CDATA["But overall, I think it's a good exposure for them. Maybe next time when you are playing in other conditions, they'll know how to bat in these conditions and they'll do much better. So our lower-order really needs to work slightly hard on their batting, because most of the good teams, they bat quite deep and we have seen, especially in the knockout stages, you need to bat deep. I am not sure about it (when asked if this was his last World Cup). I am 33, I'm still running, I'm still fit. I will have a year's time. Maybe close to next year during the T20 World Cup will be the time when I will decide whether I can continue till the 2019 World Cup or not. I think Ajinkya Rahane is one (when asked what positives he takes from the 5 month Australian tour). Right through the Test series and ODI series, he's someone who's improved his game a lot. Also if you see the batting line-up, it seems like these are the players that will continue taking Indian cricket forward. I would like to thank the fans over here, the Australian and the Indian cricket team fans. At the end of the day, when you play cricket, you want people to come to the stadium and watch the game. We have been here for over four months. Thanks to the Aussie fans and the Indian fans, who were travelling all over from India, England and all the different places. It's a bit disappointing for them, but at the same time when you play a sport only one team can win."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Dhoni</b>: "I think they (Australia) played very good cricket. Over 300 is a difficult score to chase, but I felt it was just above par. They were looking as if they will score 340 or maybe 350 but we came back quite well. But I felt we could have still bowled well. The reason being, in the afternoon, we got a bit of reverse swing going. I was a bit personally worried about the spinners without any foot marks on a fresh wicket, but their performance was good. I felt the fast bowlers could have done slightly better. But overall, we were quite happy with where we were. At the start of the tournament a lot of people didn't really think we would come so far in the tournament. But at the same time, when you come to the knockout stages, you have to lift your game. We got off to a very good start. Shikhar's dismissal to some extent was really on the softer side because that was the time when he could have milked the Australian bowling line-up. He was scoring quite freely and with an open field, he should have just batted for a few more overs. He was scoring freely so he didn't really need to play a big shot. Overall, there is pressure when you are chasing 320 runs. We have seen in cricket, pressure makes you do certain things that you don't really want to do. Naah! There was too many (when told that he left it too late in the chase). The reason being, if you lose quite a few wickets and if you are supposed to chase over 6 runs an over and also the fact that our lower-order, I don't think they can contribute as much in these conditions. So it makes it further difficult."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Smith</b>: "Yeah, it certainly does. We thought 330 was around par. We knew we had to bowl and field well and you know the boys did a terrific job tonight. Bring on Melbourne. It's nice to contribute to a few wins. It was a pretty big stage tonight, semi-final of a World Cup and just happy that we got over the line in the end. Yeah, absolutely. I always thank those people that have helped me along the way. It's very important to do that. I am just really happy with the way things are at the moment. I am just looking forward to Melbourne. It's going to be one hell of a day. Yeah, me and Maxi just thought sure he hit that, Pup (Clarke) went upstairs and it was a nick and another wicket for us (talking about Rahane's referral). It's possible (when asked if Haddin is going deaf with old age). No, it's fine, it was a thin edge and boys behind the stumps couldn't hear it. It was a nice one to get. I hope so. Hopefully, another big hundred would be nice (when asked if he has some runs in the bank for the final). It's going to be an amazing moment to play a World Cup final against New Zealand at the MCG. It's going to be absolutely amazing. Can't wait to get down there. That's right. New Zealand have played some very good cricket throughout this tournament. It's going to be nice to get them on our conditions at the MCG. Hopefully, we can put on a show for everyone that comes out down there."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Steven Smith</b> is <b>Man of the Match</b> for his magnificent 93-ball 105 and he receives it from former Sri Lankan great, <b>Aravinda de Silva.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia certainly were the deserving winners. Now the attention will shift to the final of the World Cup, where Australia will take on their Trans-Tasman rivals, New Zealand, at the MCG. Players from both sides will strive to bring out their 'A' game as they look to lift the coveted trophy.]]></line><line><![CDATA[India took a slew of wickets in the slog overs. However, James Faulkner, Johnson and Shane Watson struck meaty blows to take them to an imposing total. Umesh Yadav was one of the few bowlers, who made his mark for India. Umesh bowled aggressively and his effort bore fruit as he took four wickets. Ravichandran Ashwin too proved his mettle by bowling a fine spell during the middle overs and took the prized scalp of Glenn Maxwell.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier, runs flowed smoothly from Smith's bat as he washed away the challenge of facing up to a fine bowling line-up with aplomb. It was his magical wrist-work that flummoxed the bowlers. Smith rolled his wrists nonchalantly to find gaps on both sides of the wicket. He reached his century in style with a boundary off Mohammed Shami. Aaron Finch didn't exactly touch glorious heights with the bat, but showed resolve and a singular aim to succeed to stitch a 182-run partnership with Smith. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[MS Dhoni played with spirit and spunk, but he had too much to do. For a brief period, Ajinkya Rahane gave Dhoni the much needed support. However, once Mitchell Starc came back into the attack to produce the wicket of Rahane, the match was all but over. If Johnson was their go-to-man to take wickets in this crucial game, then Starc and Josh Hazlewood, bowled with superb control to keep the opposition on their toes. Even when Shikhar Dhawan came out all guns blazing, Hazlewood kept it simple by maintaining line and length and hitting the splice of the bat. Australia's fielding too was usually on the money.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[After Steven Smith's century underlined his stamp of authority on the proceedings, the bowlers put up a thoroughly professional performance to take Australia to their seventh final in World Cups. It was Mitchell Johnson, who bowled with venomous pace and a fiery spark to snare the key wickets of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. He dismissed Kohli with a fine bouncer that was bowled across him, with Brad Haddin taking the catch. Johnson then castled Rohit to give Australia the upper hand.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[India started their tour in early December with a loss to Australia and finish their tour with a loss against the same opposition. In between, they beat all opponents, barring Australia and England. With this loss, India's 11-match winning streak in World Cups has been ended. The fireworks go up at the SCG as the Australian fans wave the national flag in the stands. Clarke claps his hands and thanks the crowd. Maxwell talks to Umesh by putting his arm around his shoulders as the players walk off the field. Clarke is emotional and is seen crying, probably he remembered the late Phil Hughes, who was hit by that fatal bouncer at this very ground.]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to U Yadav, <b>out</b> Bowled!! That's it! <b>It's 7 out of 7 in semi-finals for Australia in World Cups</b>. They will play New Zealand in the final at the MCG on Sunday. Starc signs off in style.

Immediately, Starc, Haddin and Finch walk up to Umesh and check his health.

Another direct-hit and Dhoni makes the long walk back. Surely, Australia are in the final. Excellent throw from Maxwell. Again, he had only one stump to aim at and he was bang on target. Full and on the leg stump, Dhoni flicks it to mid-wicket, he gave up as Maxwell picked up the ball very quickly and in the end he was well short of his crease. He didn't even try to dive.

It was a well-timed shot, but Dhawan smashed it straight to Glenn Maxwell at sweeper cover and took a long walk back to the pavilion with a dejected look on his face. Hazlewood troubled Virat Kohli as well by bowling in the corridor of uncertainty and extracting bounce. Mitchell Johnson followed up Hazlewood's effort by snaffling the wicket of Kohli, with Brad Haddin taking the catch. Johnson banged it short, and bowled it across the right-hander and Kohli couldn't control the pull shot. It is risky to take on the slingy left-armer's angle of Johnson and that was a quick delivery too. To make it even better for Australia, Johnson shattered Rohit's stumps. It was a cross-seam delivery from the left-arm pacer that moved off the track. Johnson unquestionably is a cricketer made for the big occasion.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[With it being a belter of a track, Shikhar Dhawan used his feet to James Faulkner and played a volley of thunderous strokes.

India arrived in Australia in the last week of November, played 4 Tests and a couple of matches in the tri-series against Australia. They didn't win a single match, lost 3, drew 2 and one ended in a no-result. Now, in the biggest match of their tour so far, they need to chase 329 to enter the 2015 World Cup final. History is against them, no team barring Australia have chased 300+ at the SCG. Can India rewrite history? We will get to know over the next 50 overs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Smith</b>: "It was a handy little cameo there in the end (from Mitchell Johnson). To get 27 off 9 balls and to get us to 328, I think it's a good total, but we have got to bowl and field well though. I think if you get off to 328 at the start of the day you take that 9 out of 10 times. For us it's going to be about squeezing and building the pressure. Hopefully our bowlers and fielders can really do the job for us. It (the pitch) was a little tacky early on at the start. A couple sort of popped but it got better after the first 8 or 10 overs. It's a pretty good wicket. It's always nice getting hundreds at the SCG, it's my favourite place to play. It's a World Cup semi-final, it's a pretty big stage. Hopefully the boys can back it up in the field now and we can join New Zealand in the final."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Michael Clarke struggled to find gaps in the field and soon he lost his wicket to a short ball. With Finch and Clarke getting out in quick succession, India pulled the batting side back to some extent. It was James Faulkner, Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson, who with some lethal strikes lifted Australia's sagging morale.  For India, Umesh picked up four wickets. In fact, Umesh used the short ball smartly. With the odd ball stopping on the batsman, sometimes it can be difficult to play the pull shot. Ashwin bowled with unremitting control. The deck is still good for batting and the outfield is lightning quick. It comes down to whether India can handle the pressure of playing in a semi-final. On the other hand, Australia will look to mix it up by using cross-seam and slower deliveries to get it to grip off the surface.]]></line><line><![CDATA[When MS Dhoni introduced the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin into the attack, Smith refused to buckle down. He used the crease to milk them for singles and twos. With Smith nearing his century, he hoicked Shami across the line for a six. He then reached his hundred in style by clouting Shami for another boundary. Once Smith was dismissed, Glenn Maxwell for  a brief period, bedazzled the crowd with a cameo. With Maxwell in a belligerent mood, Dhoni took a brave call of bringing Ashwin back into the attack and he repaid the faith by producing the wicket of Maxwell. It has to be remembered that in the past, Maxwell has usually smacked Ashwin all over the park.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier, India started on a good note with both Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav bowling with a decent burst of pace and generating swing to keep the batsmen on their toes. Umesh was rewarded with the important wicket of David Warner. It was Smith, who took them out of troubled waters by unfurling a series of boundaries. He cracked Umesh for four fours in the 10th over. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[In the backdrop of a sizzling atmosphere, Steven Smith's marvellous exhibition of stroke-play helped Australia to notch up a massive score. Smith reigned supreme as he showcased majestic wrist-work to put the bowlers under pressure. There were occasions when the bowlers were left to scratch their heads in disbelief as Smith bisected gaps in the field on both sides of the wicket with customary ease. Aaron Finch, who struggled for timing and placement early on in his innings also played a major role by compiling a gutsy knock.  <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[It was strange to see Dhoni not give the ball to Umesh, who has picked four wickets. He had one over up his sleeve, but Dhoni opted for Mohit.

Smith continued to deal in boundaries by picking a slower delivery from Mohit Sharma to land a meaty blow down the ground. With Smith checking in a series of boundaries, Finch too made his presence felt by playing a cheeky paddle sweep. It was Umesh Yadav, who eventually dismissed the well-set Smith. The power-hitter Glenn Maxwell, who replaced Smith at the crease yet again looked to take his game to an elevated plane. Ashwin though, provided the vital breakthrough by sending Maxwell back to the pavilion. Umesh followed it up by dismissing Finch to give India a glimmer of hope of restricting the opposition.

All of us are looking good. That's something that is very important. Everybody has got a chance to bat, bowl, fielding has been good, overall preparation looks good. Not really. I feel it wouldn't really change much. The toss is something beyond the control, you have to accept it. But, yes we would have also batted first as well. Everyone is fit. So, that give us a liberty of playing with the same squad. I think each and every one in a game like this you have to be at your best irrespective of whether you are opening the innings or batting in the middle order. So, get off to a good start, if you get a good start make sure you score big, that is something we always emphasize on. The partnership is more important than individual performance. So, that has been the key for us throughout this World Cup."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Clarke:</b> "Not too much (on what has he said to his mates before the game). It's about enjoying. It's a big occasion, it's a special day. We know we are up against a fantastic team, but we love playing here at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The boys are ready to go, they have trained really well. That's all I can ask for. We are going to have a <b>bat</b> Flem (Damien Fleming), thank you. I think we are about to find out. The wicket looks great. I think it will be pretty good for both innings, runs on the board is the reason why we have gone for batting first. Same XI for us today. I thought he (Hazlewood) was exceptional.

There's no comparison. He just sits alone when it comes to ODI cricket. Character, a steely character, there is a desire to win, the desire to play as a unit (asked what impressed him the most in this team). The desire to play for each other, which has been absolutely brilliant to see. That's what you need in any team (the mix of youth and age). You need that because, if you see the way they have fielded, it's because of that. There's youth there, there are some young legs there and of course you need experience on an occasion like this. Fabulous (to be here today). I feel like putting on my blues and getting out there. 30 years to the day, which the boys know, India beat NZ in the world championship of cricket in the semi-final and I was the Man of the Match, so I said if you get me one Man of the Match today, history might just repeat itself. Pleasure, go India!"]]></line><line><![CDATA["You can (overplay a big occasion). If you think too much or too far ahead, you could make mistakes. Our mantra has been don't think too far ahead. Forget the past and live in the present and be calm in the present. Massive (when asked if Dhoni's presence is an advantage). If there is a bigger word than massive, use that word. Your vocabulary is better than mine, so go right ahead and use that word, because that's how big a player he is. It's not about individuals, it's about a collective team effort and that's what team India has brought to the table in this World Cup. It's not about individual performances, but every time when someone is needed, he's put up his hand, each one of those 11 players."]]></line><line><![CDATA["I've not seen the pitch but I think MS (Dhoni) has his plans. If you win the toss, obviously you would want to bat first. Why should you change it (the team) when nothing has happened? They've done brilliantly, each one of them in the 11 and they'll go out and enjoy the occasion today. I think the calmness will be the key today. you got to be calm there, soak in the pressure and then enjoy. Just think that you've got a stage there, you've been watched by 60000 people, so go out there and give it your best shot, enjoy it. They (the players) are very calm, very composed and looking forward to this game and it's a great occasion, a world cup semifinal and on the back of being the holders, the way they have played, I think everyone in India should be proud and all the Indian fans watching around the world, you should be proud of this cricket team the way they have played."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Shastri</b>: "Absolutely fine (when asked how are the soldiers). They are ready and up for it like never before, let me assure you that. They want to go out there and play fearless, aggressive cricket and enjoy the occasion. They don't need any motivation, they've played fabulous cricket in this World Cup. They know each one of them can hold their heads high with the way they have played and as a unit they have looked fabulous. Today is game 8 and they have to approach it just in that fashion that they've approached the other ones. Doesn't matter (when told that game 8 is against Australia). Not at all (when reminded that there have to be scars from what's gone before). That's all baggage. This is the big one, those mickey mouse tournaments are over. This is where you want to win.

But India won their last encounter - a World Cup quarter-final at Motera in Ahmedabad. That was a gripping game which India won thanks to Yuvraj and Raina's calmness under pressure in a chase. If you look at the overall record, in the last five meetings between the sides, India has won two, Australia one with two games washed out.

His audacious batting will be a major concern for India but Ashwin, with 12 wickets, is also in good form.

Get rid of the Big Show and become the showstopper."]]></line><line><![CDATA["The stats concur with Maxwell's assessment.

The Australian dasher has always held the advantage over India's premier spinner.

During the second Test in Brisbane, Rohit engaged in a sledging duel with Johnson and it proved to be costly for India. Johnson smashed an aggressive 88 and picked up 4 wickets, including Rohit in the second innings to give Australia victory. Johnson has underperformed in this World Cup so far but he will be desperate to put in a hostile show on the big stage.

Talking to <b>Cricket Australia</b>, Kohli said, "We felt as a group that we need to step up and make corrections now. We don't really have too much time because you can't afford to go into the World Cup thinking 'Okay, fine, we have things to work on but we can do it over a period of time'," he said, about the team's '180 degree turnaround'.]]></line><line><![CDATA["Yes, it all depends on the wicket and how it is," Rohit spoke of the SCG pitch. "Of course, if you look at the history of the city, it gives a lot of time towards spin bowlers, and they actually come out and bowl really well. [If] you see the Test matches we played in Australia, the spinners played a huge part. So I think if it does [on Thursday], we've got the spinners to do it.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Rohit, speaking to the media, reckoned that spin will definitely play a role come match day.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Meanwhile former Aussie pacer <b>Brett Lee</b> reckoned Australia will win. "It is going to be a lot of fun. Full crowds and packed stadium. I honestly think Australia will win on Thursday night. But you also got to think about the chance of India. They have played extremely well, won seven from seven. Australia have won five from seven, that's including one wash out. We have to wait and see," Lee said.]]></line><line><![CDATA["I really do think it's a 50-50 call. In all semifinals, the team that plays well in the first 15 overs of the match, be it with the ball or bat is the team that gets ahead and wins that game. They have all got power, all got finesse, they have got different kind angles to create in the field," he said.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Michael Vaughan</b> said it was a 50-50 call when asked to pick his favourite in the second semi-final at the SCG. "MS Dhoni knows how to win World Cups and that goes quite a long way. There is something about him and World Cups and what he did after the tri-series is remarkable. Change of team and change of mentality. The change in the way they played in the World Cup after the tri-series," he said.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ganguly</b> also feels that Kohli will be the man for the occasion and expects a big knock from him. "For India, I think, the man would be Virat Kohli. He had a fabulous Test series against Australia; his record against Australia is outstanding. He is one of the biggest match-winners in one-day cricket for the team and at the moment and he will be pumped up. Kohli will play a big knock tomorrow. Don't sledge him. That's my advice to Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc. Because they did that in the Test matches and he came out with four hundreds."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sourav Ganguly</b> writing exclusively on our site, reckons that the semi-final will be a battle between Dhoni and Clarke. "It's gonna be a battle between the two captains. We saw how AB de Villiers gave the game away to New Zealand and I mean it when I say it. But tomorrow it will be a battle between two captains who are very good leaders. MS Dhoni is slightly ahead because he has already led the team to three world championship wins - one World Cup, one T20 World Cup and one Champions Trophy. Clarke has played in a World Cup-winning team but has not captained a World Cup-winning team. For me the pressure will be on Australia. It's a home game at the SCG. They say it's going be more Blue than Gold tomorrow but still the pressure will be on Australia."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Finch expects the biggest game he has ever have played to be a huge occasion. "You can't put it any other way. It's going to be exciting. It's a huge opportunity to show our skills off as a team. We've played some great cricket over the last two years and there's no reason we're not going to go into this game confident. I think we've got every right to be," he said. "Whatever happens I suppose if we stick to our game plans and play well it goes a long way towards winning the game. It's about being aggressive without being over the top."]]></line><line><![CDATA["When you're looking to be aggressive with the new ball, having been here for four months has probably adapted their lengths a little bit.

Aussie bowling legend <b>Shane Warne</b> spent a considerable amount of time with the Australian team during the team's net session on the eve of the match. Warne not only had a lengthy talk with skipper Michael Clarke, but also rolled his arms over and had the likes of Aaron Finch, Shane Watson and James Faulkner in a spot of bother in the nets.

He is prepared to accept that too. "I think it's a no-brainer. I think we know they will," he said in response to a question if he expected India fans to outnumber Australian supporters but pointed out that his team had got used to that idea by playing in India. "I think it's fine. We've played in India a number of times and they out-support us there as well."]]></line><line><![CDATA["I think MS Dhoni deserves a lot of credit for the way he's captained his team especially being defeated in the Test series and the tri-series to be able to turn things around. Obviously they're at the top of their game at the moment. So we're prepared for that. We know we're playing against a very good team that obviously won the last World Cup," Clarke said.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Michael Clarke</b> has conceded that the big-match experience of more Indian players could make a difference on Thursday. "I said at the start of this tournament that I thought India were going to be one of the toughest teams to beat. My main reason for that is because they've been in the conditions for so long. They've played so much cricket in Australia. They've worked out how to take wickets. They've worked out how to score runs, and they've shown that through this tournament," he said.]]></line><line><![CDATA["It's been a long time. Seven years. I can recall that very well. It's really fresh in my memory because it was the first final of the CB series, and the great Sachin Tendulkar was batting alongside me, so there is no way I can forget that."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Rohit also has great memories of the SCG having played a significant part in India winning the first final of the 2008 CB series. Rohit made 66 and was involved in a crucial stand with Sachin Tendulkar. "It was a very important game. We had to win that game and we were chasing 240-odd. So, yeah, we pretty much did whatever we wanted to," he said.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There is a lot of pre-match talk before the game and let's get straight into it. Rohit Sharma insists that wearing the team jersey is enough to motivate him and he does not need someone else to pump him up for the semi-final. "It is important for me when I wear that India cap, I need to work hard. I don't need anyone else to come and talk or whatever it is. I bat the way I want to and I think I would make sure that nothing gets into the head. I just want to play my game. It doesn't matter what people are talking and things like that."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Quarter-final:</b> India faced Bangladesh at the MCG and after a few jitters while batting, posted a 300 plus total thanks to a hundred from Rohit Sharma. With the total on the board, the bowlers as they have done all tournament did their job and finished off their Asian neighbors well inside 50 overs to move into the semis. It was another commanding performance from the Indian team in the tournament and kept their unbeaten run going.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>India:</b> India maintained a clean slate in the group stages. It began with a win against Pakistan at Adelaide. South Africa were humbled at the MCG. UAE were easy meat. West Indies posed a challenge, but India came through that. Ireland were taught a lesson. Zimbabwe fought till the end, but their lack of winning games went against them as India hung on and won thanks to Raina and Dhoni to remain unbeaten in the tournament.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Quarter-final:</b> Pakistan were expected to be tricky opposition in the quarters but except for the tremendous spell from Wahab Riaz which had them on the ropes for a while, Australia were always in command. Once they survived Riaz's spell, Australia cantered home to victory to set up a semi-final date with India at the Sydney Cricket Ground.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>The road to the semis.</b> Australia: Australia began with a bang thumping England. Then there was a washout against Bangladesh before losing a thriller against New Zealand. The no-result and the loss to New Zealand meant they couldn't finish top of the group. Australia smashed Afghanistan then won a high-scoring game against Sri Lanka before having it easy against Scotland.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There have been so many altercations on the pitch when India and Australia play each other. Two instances immediately come to mind. McGrath sledging Tendulkar in Nairobi and the little man returning the favor and Michael Slater's angry argument with Rahul Dravid in 2001 at Kolkata. Not to forget Monkey Gate in 2008. It will be interesting to see what kind of sledging and how far it goes in the semi-final.]]></line><line><![CDATA[What is an India-Australia clash without verbals and sledging. James Faulkner certainly has raised the heat saying there will be verbals when the two sides meet in the semi-final. "I think there always is in the game, if there isn't you've got problems," Faulkner said. "It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final, it's cut-throat. There's going to be words said and it's going to be a really tough contest. Neither team will be backing down."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sledging:</b> "Make offensive remarks to (an opposing batsman) in order to break their concentration."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Former Aussie great, <b>Ian Chappell</b> too picked out Ponting's innings as the difference between the two sides. "Ponting played magnificently. He is only a little guy but has a reputation of hitting the golf ball a long way. Anybody who saw him bat at the Wanderers that day will understand why. Once he started going, he let loose and hit some huge sixes. Virtually, by the end of the first 50 overs, the World Cup final was over."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Javagal Srinath who was a part of the Indian side that lost the game was effusive in his praise of Ricky Ponting, saying, "The speciality of Ricky Ponting is his ability to win matches. It is not just about scoring runs. He had the capacity to maneuver the team and take them along."]]></line><line><![CDATA[The 2003 World Cup final between India and Australia was expected to be a cracker. Australia were unbeaten in the tournament till then, while India had won 8 in a row before the final. But the Aussies simply blew the Indians away. The tone was set in the opening over when an over enthusiastic Zaheer Khan was hit for 15 runs and Australia never looked back. Ricky Ponting was at his brilliant best as he conjured up 140 runs - one of the all-time best knocks in World Cup history. Australia made 359 and the rest was a formality, especially after Tendulkar was dismissed for 4 in the opening over.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Two days later Tendulkar hit 134 as India beat Australia to lift the trophy. These two innings by Tendulkar are considered by many to be his finest ODI innings and also the best innings played by an Indian against Australia in ODIs. Such was the impact of Tendulkar's innings that Shane Warne admitted to having nightmares of Sachin.]]></line><line><![CDATA["But that will to win and desire to go through to the finals was there in our dressing room and some good cricket by all of us helped us reach the finals and we lifted the trophy as well."]]></line><line><![CDATA["That match itself was a memorable one because we went back to the dressing room [after a delay] and there was a fresh target. Not many runs were added but about four or five overs were deducted so the target became stiffer," Tendulkar recalled.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Sachin himself felt the desert storm was a new experience for him. He told <b>Sport360.com</b>, "We were playing Australia and suddenly [there was] this new experience of a desert storm for me. I was worried because I thought, looking at my size and weight - I weighed a lot less then - I thought I was going to get blown away by the storm. I was moving closer to Adam Gilchrist, hoping that if I was getting blown away I was going to grab hold of him. Some extra weight always helps!"]]></line><line><![CDATA["We knew that Sachin likes to be left alone and be himself before he goes out to bat. The coach or the captain didn't feel the need to instruct what the Little Master had to do out there in the middle once play resumed knowing that Sachin himself was aware of what had to be accomplished. He was his usual self - quiet and focused," added Mongia.]]></line><line><![CDATA["Nobody in the dressing room went close to him and uttered a word."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Sachin's innings was seen from close quarters by Nayan Mongia who was a part of the game. He was full of praise for Sachin and recollected that knock recently to <b>Hyderabad Chronicle</b>. Here is what he had to say: "On that day Sachin could have done anything. Such was his form and frame of mind. The picture of Sachin sitting in the dressing room with his gear on while the sandstorm blew across the ground is embedded in most of our minds."]]></line><line><![CDATA['Operation Desert Storm' as it has come to be known is actually the name given to Sachin Tendulkar's masterful innings of 143 which ensured India qualify ahead of New Zealand, into the final of the tri-series in Sharjah. Australia had set India a target of 285 and a sand storm had stopped play for about 25 minutes. After the break India needed 237 in 46 overs to beat New Zealand's NRAJ and sneak into the final. That day, Tendulkar was batting on a different planet as he took India single-handedly to the final. The match was made even more memorable by the commentary of the late Tony Greig who went into paroxysms of excitement whenever Tendulkar hit a six.]]></line><line><![CDATA[We have set the bar quite high in our opening few paras, so it will be a dampener if we don't keep up with that. Two instances have to be mentioned when it comes to India-Australia clashes. In ODIs, especially. One is Desert Storm and the other the 2003 World Cup final. Let us go back in time and refresh our memories of those two matches, starting with Desert Storm.]]></line><line><![CDATA[So here it is then.

If the teams turn up at the park with their A games, fans could get a game to cherish.<br/><br/>India have had a fine run in the World Cup, winning all seven starts, but they will have to be well on top of their A game to be able to beat the strong and determined home side and get to within one match of having the chance to defending the crown, a feat achieved only by the great sides of the West Indies and Australia.<br/><br/>To be sure, it is not beyond Dhoni and his men. The top three batsmen, Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli all relish the challenge of squaring up against the best bowling line-up. If they can extend that to Thursday's massive showdown, India can keep their tryst with the grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.<br/><br/>India's bowlers have caught the eye by lifting their game and executing the plans admirably. Mohit Sharma's back-of-the-hand slower delivery could be one the handiest weapons on the SCG track that is not expected to be aid bowlers overtly. The slowness of the pitch could make off-spinner R Ashwin's variations of pace and Ravindra Jadeja's accuracy key, too.<br/><br/>After spending an evening, sweating under covers as it rained over Sydney, the pitch was back under the charge of its caretakers, curator Tom Parker and his colleagues. Between sessions of rolling spread over the day, the pitch had a number of curious visitors, including Australia coach Darren Lehmenn, Chairman of Selectors Rod Marsh and his colleague Mark Waugh.<br/><br/>Clearly, the curator's attempt has been to ensure that the pitch would be even-paced unlike in the quarterfinal where it started off being dual-paced and challenged the Sri Lanka batsmen. It would be important for the team batting first to ensure that not too many wickets are lost in the mandatory powerplay.<br/><br/>Shane Watson's show of character must count as a positive spin-off of Australia's engaging quarterfinal skirmish with Pakistan or a fired-up left-arm paceman Wahab Riaz, to be more specific. His presence in the middle-order does lend experienced muscle to go with the youthful exuberance of Glenn Maxwell.<br/><br/>New Zealand's entry into the title round more so as squad that has won all its eight matches in the World Cup can work as an extra spark for Australia, known to have a long history of intense antipodean rivalry. But as Australian captain Michael Clarke pointed out repeatedly, his team did not need such external factors to find the drive to win the game.<br/><br/>Of course, Australia have not lost an ODI in Sydney in the last three years but that must be tempered by the knowledge that only one of those games the recent victory over Sri Lanka has been played in the month of March. And it is of some significance that India beat Australia in March 2008, with Rohit Sharma sharing a century stand with Sachin Tendulkar.<br/><br/>The South Africans felt the crowd pressure a couple of times in the tournament, notably against India in Melbourne on February 22 and New Zealand in Auckland on Tuesday. Will it be the Australians' turn to be playing an 'away' game at home, given the hordes of Indian supporters who will turn up at the SCG on Thursday?<br/><br/>For this one time, we can believe the truism that is often spouted in limited-over cricket. For once, let us accept that the team that keeps its nerves in check and expresses itself under pressure on Thursday would earn the right to take that flight to Melbourne for the ICC Cricket World Cup final against New Zealand.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>India</b> (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Axar Patel, Stuart Binny, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ambati Rayudu]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b> (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Marsh, Xavier Doherty, George Bailey, Pat Cummins]]></line>
