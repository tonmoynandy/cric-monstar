			<line><![CDATA[That's stumps on Day 2. A day which could have been so much worse for the Kiwis had it not been for those quick wickets towards the fag-end. Atleast, it gives them some hope with both set batsmen back in the hutch. They were rubbed into the dirt by a humongous 289-run partnership for the most part. It began promisingly for the hosts though. Boult utilized the early morning nip on offer to get rid of Khawaja. But what followed was heavily distressing and disheartening. The pitch, where the ball darted around at the same time yesterday, went benign. Completely. Full credit to the pair of Burns and Smith though. The duo completely shut the door and offered very little to no chances. Their record-breaking stand has helped the Aussies to within touching distance of New Zealand's first innings score and even raised hopes of a crushing lead. One that will completely take the game away. A big effort is needed first thing tomorrow and as the cliche goes "The first session is crucial". We'll be back to bring you all the action. See you then..]]></line><line><![CDATA[109.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, and he's survived. Slippery short of length delivery around chest high, Lyon works it towards mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[109.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, quick one and well directed towards the badge, safely hunches under it]]></line><line><![CDATA[109.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, oh no. Make him play. Lyon is allowed another let-go with a short ball outside off]]></line><line><![CDATA[109.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, an easy leave. Good height on the short ball but it's outside off]]></line><line><![CDATA[109.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, another one banged in halfway, and Lyon decides to fend it off rather than ducking. Bunts it off the sticker into the off-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[109.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, brisk short ball gunning for the rib-cage from round the wicket, Lyon barely keeps it out in front of short leg off the splice]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[108.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, breathes a sigh of relief after patting a short of length delivery into the off-side. He would hope his job is done for the day. Over to the night-watchman]]></line><line><![CDATA[108.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, even fuller on middle and leg, Voges gets his bat well in front of pad and blocks into the off-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[108.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, better length. Fullish just outside off, Voges has to reach out in defence]]></line><line><![CDATA[108.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, no problems there. Firm as a rock on the back foot to defend]]></line><line><![CDATA[108.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, shuffles across towards off to defend a back of a length delivery]]></line><line><![CDATA[108.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, wayward bumper as it's well down leg, Voges squats his knees as a precautionary measure]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[107.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, easily defended off the back foot. Got to get him forward]]></line><line><![CDATA[107.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, angled in towards leg, Lyon is too quick to close the bat-face and his leading edge nearly pops to silly mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[107.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, slips in a bouncer and Lyon rushes to crouch under it]]></line><line><![CDATA[Switches to round the wicket..]]></line><line><![CDATA[107.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, and again. Excellent awareness of his sticks and the left-armer's angle, lets it pass]]></line><line><![CDATA[107.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, that's another good leave. Judges the line early and again pulls the bat inside the line]]></line><line><![CDATA[107.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Voges, 1 run, allows Voges to get off strike with a gentle one on the hips, glanced down to fine leg]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[106.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Lyon, no run, keeps it full and straight and Lyon shows he is no mug with the bat with another stout forward block]]></line><line><![CDATA[106.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Lyon, no run, prods forward to a full ball and defends into the on-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[106.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Lyon, <b>FOUR</b>, excellent delivery. Holds its line from a good length around off, Lyon had to play at it. He is done in by the late movement and gets a thick edge which flies away past the diving gully into the fence]]></line><line><![CDATA[106.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Lyon, no run, length ball wide of off, another delivery wasted]]></line><line><![CDATA[106.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Lyon, no run, skiddy back of a length delivery which fizzes through to the keeper after being left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[106.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, 1 run, back of a length delivery around off, Voges hopes on the crease and tucks it through square leg]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[105.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, moves inches forward to a length delivery and blocks it back]]></line><line><![CDATA[105.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, swishes his bat inside the line deliberately to leave a length ball outside off]]></line><line><![CDATA[105.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, Lyon is expecting a bumper and almost crouches instantly as the ball is released from Wagner's hand. Well underneath it]]></line><line><![CDATA[105.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, gets the line wrong with this bouncer, it's down leg allowing an easy let-go]]></line><line><![CDATA[105.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Lyon, no run, pushed across the night-watchman on a good length, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Nathan Lyon, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[105.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, <b>out</b> Caught by Guptill!! You gotta be kidding me! It's like an action replay of Burns's dismissal. That short ball strategy only took 250+ runs to work and it's produced two wickets now. Both set batsmen gone. Smith swivels across and pulls it well but again, it's straight to Guptill at square leg. Window of opportunity for NZ. <b>Smith c Guptill b Wagner 138(241) [4s-17]</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Wagner to Smith, <b>THAT'S OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[104.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, draws him forward with a fullish ball, Voges is prepared to offer some respect in defence]]></line><line><![CDATA[104.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, back of a length delivery which holds its line outside off and squares up Voges slightly as he defends]]></line><line><![CDATA[104.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Voges, no run, prods forward to a full ball on middle and blocks]]></line><line><![CDATA[104.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Smith, 1 run, moves across on the back foot to punch a similar delivery to deep point]]></line><line><![CDATA[104.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Smith, no run, hits a back of a length outside off, steered towards point]]></line><line><![CDATA[104.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Smith, no run, length ball outside off, left alone]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Matt Henry [24.0-5-82-0] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[103.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Voges, no run, another short of length delivery which is safely blunted back down the pitch]]></line><line><![CDATA[103.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Voges, no run, falls down the leg-side this time, Voges moves inside the line and leaves]]></line><line><![CDATA[103.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Voges, no run, he's hit him. That's more like it. Vicious short ball on the stumps, and Voges can't get out of the way. He simply stands his ground, turns his head backward while raising his arms in hope. Smacked under the arm-pit]]></line><line><![CDATA[103.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Voges, no run, now Wagner has some added fuel in the tank. Another short one, but will require some more effort to climb on a tall Voges, worked safely wide of short-leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Adam Voges, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[103.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Burns, <b>out</b> Caught by Guptill!! A wicket. After ages. The short ball ploy which looked like a sure-shot brain implosion has come off. Wagner bangs it in and gets much more height on this one. Even so, Burns is able to pull it nicely. Hits it well enough but just that it went straight to square leg where Guptill takes it inches from the turf. <b>Burns c Guptill b Wagner 170(321) [4s-20]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Wagner to Burns, <b>THAT'S OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[103.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Burns, <b>FOUR</b>, the field is set for the short ball but Wagner can't get it high enough, the line is on leg-stump to make it easier for Burns as he helps the pull fine]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[102.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, 1 run, nurdled behind square to procure a single which will help him keep strike]]></line><line><![CDATA[102.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, no run, shimmies down, gets too close to the ball and jams the drive into the pitch towards mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[102.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, no run, lots of air on this one as it drifts across off, lands in the blockhole, squeezed to backward point]]></line><line><![CDATA[102.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, no run, flatter on middle, tucked to short mid-wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[102.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, no run, backs away a touch and punches it to short cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[102.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, no run, teased up on off, defended with a forward lunge]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[101.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, no run, nearly on the walk while whipping a full ball to mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[101.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, no run, plonks his front foot across and defends this length ball with bat and pad close]]></line><line><![CDATA[101.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, no run, fraction full outside off and driven to cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[101.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, no run, shuffling a long way across to cover the line of a short of length delivery]]></line><line><![CDATA[101.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, no run, covers the off-stump and lets this length ball through]]></line><line><![CDATA[101.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner to Smith, <b>FOUR</b>, dabbed away between gully and slip.

Misses off-stump by a whisker. Smith decides to take liberties and looks to dab a length ball fine towards the third man fence, it's not short enough to be playing it. Chops it off a thick inside edge and collects four. Another record has been broken.

There was lots of speculation as to how the pitch would behave today. Whether there will be anywhere near enough help like on the morning of Day 1? But no. The sideways movement has dissipated. There was a little up front which Boult exploited to nip off Khawaja. It was followed by a good intense battle between bat and ball. However, the Kiwi bowlers got a bit too impatient after the drinks break deviating from the good length area to offer a barrage of half-volleys. That evaporated all the pressure which had been built early on and allowed this pair to seize the upper hand. Looks like a long day's toil ahead as this pitch will only get better and better.]]></line><line><![CDATA[48.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson to Burns, 2 runs, a nice gentle drive through the covers to close off what has been a decent first session for Australia.

The highlight of Day 1 was Brendon McCullum belting out the quickest Test century in just 54 balls. He unleashed a stream of fours and sixes to harvest a sparkling hundred and help his team recover. McCullum rode his luck, as he was dismissed by Pattinson off a no-ball. However, it has to be said that none of the Australian bowlers were able to curb him for long. Corey Anderson, too, cracked an eye-wateringly imposing fifty.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Brendon McCullum's whirlwind hundred ensured that New Zealand posted a competitive total on the board. In fact, McCullum also registered the quickest Test ton, which came in a mere 54 balls. Corey Anderson too played his part with a vital fifty. Trent Boult then sent Warner back to the pavilion to give the hosts a slight edge. Earlier, Australia's seamers landed crucial blows to put the tourists in the ascendancy. However, the turning point of the day came when Pattinson dismissed McCullum off a no-ball. Once he got the reprieve, New Zealand's skipper played with a dash of fearlessness and cracked a blistering century.  Join us tomorrow for the second day's play. Until then, goodbye.]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Henry to Khawaja, no run, Henry keeps it full and just outside off, defended with a straight bat.

They were down and out for all count when skipper, Brendon McCullum, playing in his 101st and last Test walked on. He made a name for himself with his bold and aggressive batting. It doesn't come off everytime, but when it does, it's awe-inspiring. Australia didn't know what hit them as fours and sixes were clubbed with ease. He found a willing partner in Corey Anderson and the pair added 179 runs from just 112 balls. McCullum also recorded the fastest ever Test ton - off just 54 deliveries, beating the previous record of 56 - jointly held by Sir Viv Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq. What a way to go. Inspired by his aggression, the later New Zealand batsmen adopted the same strategy, BJ Watling helped himself to a 57-ball 58 and the hosts finished with 370 on the board. The pitch is still helping the pacers and the New Zealand bowlers will fancy their chances. Join us in a while..]]></line><line><![CDATA[65.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird to Watling, <b>out</b> Caught by Burns!! Watling's superb hand comes to an end and New Zealand have been bowled out for 370.

Well, it needed a marvellous catch by Lyon at deep backward square leg to bring to an end what was a believe-it-or-not knock. The fans who came to watch McCullum bat in his final Test have certainly got their money's worth. On expected lines, he gets a standing ovation while making his way back to the hut. Raises his bat to acknowledge it as well. Coming back to the wicket, McCullum almost sunk on one knee and played the pick shot. Lyon at backward square leg moved forward and dived to pouch it with both hands. He kept his eyes on the ball all the way through there. <b>Brendon McCullum c Lyon b Pattinson 145(79) [4s-21 6s-6]</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Pattinson to Brendon McCullum, <b>THAT'S OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[44.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitchell Marsh to Corey Anderson, 2 runs, cries of catch it, but there is nobody to take it at square third man.

Woah, they are catching everything these Aussies. And McCullum's innings is done. Or is it? Dear me. Pattinson's heel is on the line. Heartbreak for 11 Aussies as opposed to the pure ecstasy in this packed Hagley Oval. Skids on from a back of a length outside off, McCullum tries to upper-cut it over the infield.

At the other end, Brendon McCullum, playing in his final Test, unfurled a series of eye-catching shots and looked in ominous touch.

Instead, he moves his front leg out of the way and pats it with the swing towards point]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird to Williamson, no run, and again, a batsman being troubled on the back foot. Indicative of a quick pitch as they don't have enough time to adjust.

Back of a length delivery outside off, no need to play]]></line><line><![CDATA[8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird to Latham, no run, things are happening. Plenty of them. Some balls are going through nicely whilst others are not. This one sticks in the pitch on a good length and Latham is again found to be too early on the flick. Leading edge spoons up and teases past Bird's outstretched left hand towards mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird to Latham, no run, hurries on from a short of length and rushes Latham in his attempted pull.

Keeps going and going. But no says the umpire. Williamson had got his front leg outside the line of off to foil the LBW appeal. But again, lots of encouragement for the seamers. Darts back in from a good length and beats Williamson on the inside edge of the forward prod]]></line><line><![CDATA[7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Williamson, no run, it's hooping around with good bounce, but the line isn't close enough this time to force Williamson to play]]></line><line><![CDATA[7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Williamson, no run, allows the back of a length delivery to come on before dabbing it to gully]]></line><line><![CDATA[7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Williamson, no run, presses across to a fullish ball outside off and pushes it gently towards point]]></line><line><![CDATA[7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Williamson, no run, pretty much similar to the Guptill delivery.

Goes through nicely to the keeper from a good length outside off]]></line><line><![CDATA[6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, pitched up just outside off, softly driven to mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, nips in slightly from a good length just outside off, Latham had already committed to a big forward defence, wasn't able to adjust and gets a thick inside edge into the on-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, good stride forward to a fairly full ball and hits it to mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, good pace and bounce through to the keeper from a back of a length after Latham left it alone]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Kane Williamson, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, <b>out</b> Caught by Burns!! Inevitable. The way things were going, Guptill is lucky to have played this long. Pattinson hits the deck hard on a back of a length and gets it to nip back in at Guptill who tried to tuck it away. Only managed a thick inside edge. The ball deflected onto thigh pad and popped up in front of Burns at short leg who dives forward to catch a simple one. They check for the no-ball which is tricky, but Pattinson has some part of the heel behind the line. <b>Guptill c Burns b Pattinson 18(22) [4s-3]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Pattinson to Guptill, <b>THAT'S OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, no run, similar ball to the previous one, no stroke offered]]></line><line><![CDATA[5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Guptill greets it with a lifted bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Latham, 1 run, another leading edge, and it's safe again. We have seen a couple of these already. Is it holding up in the surface. Hurled on a short of length on middle, Latham looks to work it through the on-side off the back foot, but ends up being too early. Bobs it in front of mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Latham, no run, the length is much shorter this time and the ball simply skids on outside off, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Latham, no run, gripping stuff! This is going to be a thorough examination of defences. A rare thing in modern day cricket. Lands on a length just outside off with a hint of curl back in, that drew Latham into the forward defence, but then it cunningly nipped away and made him look very silly. Broad daylight between bat and ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, zips back in from a short of length to once again sneak past Guptill's inside edge and smack him near the tummy]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, wide enough of off stump to enable a safe leave]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, hangs back to a slightly short of length delivery and blocks. More in his comfort zone, this length]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, an absolute jaffa! Angled in with the arm on a good length outside off, then straightens off the deck to leave Guptill stranded on the front foot. Beats the outside edge of a tentative defence by a fair way]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, judges the line well after it comes out of the hand and lets it through to the keeper]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, zipping from a good length outside off, Guptill shoulders arms]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Latham, no run, length delivery outside off, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Latham, no run, here's the more old-fashioned Latham leaving everything he can]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, 3 runs, there's an event every ball with Guptill on strike. This one's popped up off a thick leading edge and gone wide of a diving mid-on. Length ball on middle, holds its line a bit and finds Guptill closing the bat-face early. Mid-on throws himself to the left but can't reach it]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, no run, oh, this is probing stuff. Testing every bit of Guptill's defence like a secret probe. Jags back from a good length outside off to cut him in half as he was caught on the crease]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, <b>FOUR</b>, not very smart batting this. Just plants his front foot down to a length ball in the channel, a little bit of away movement takes a thick outside edge which evades the outstretched right hand of a diving third slip]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, no run, oh, has that been dropped? It has. It has. <b>Burns has shelled one at short leg after juggling with it</b>. Went quickly to him though. Nips in a touch from a fuller length to catch a thick inside edge as Guptill tries to flick, then deflects onto pad before popping up towards Burns's chest. He attempts to cushion it on the body but fails to do so. Then gropes at the rebound. Fails again]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, good length delivery outside off, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, hits the deck hard on a back of a length and keeps nagging away, another well judged leave]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, thought about having a flirt with a length ball slanted across, then withheld his temptations]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, 2 runs, forces Hazlewood to bowl closer to him, ends up straying on the pads and is picked away through mid-wicket.

Didn't move his back foot too far across, trusting the bounce in this pitch. There is a desperate chase given which culminates in a valiant dive but to no avail]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, no run, pulls the length back on off and middle, Guptill simply turns it to short-leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, <b>FOUR</b>, oh gorgeous. Just hold your pose Guptill. Don't bother running. Juicy half-volley presented in the hope of some movement. But if you pitch it that full, you allow the batsman to get right on top of the ball. Flows into the on-drive straight of mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattinson to Guptill, no run, huge appeal from Pattinson first ball as he gets a scrambled seam delivery to dart back in from a good length just outside off, and hit Guptill on the back knee. Initial reactions from everyone were of an inside edge but no. Doing too much]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>James Pattinson, right-arm fast, comes into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, fullish and shaping in on off, Latham pushes it with a closed bat into the on-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Latham, no run, oopsy, some hesitation in Latham's mind this time.

Had the privilege to lead for a couple of years so hope to cap off now. A couple of changes in the form of Wagner and Henry coming in. There is grass, live grass here.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Smith:</b> We're going to bowl. Looks to be some moisture in the wicket and some grass. Hopefully our bowlers go well here. Pattinson comes in for Siddle.]]></line><line><![CDATA[We have live pictures from the Hagley Oval now which show the grass banks brimming with people.]]></line><line><![CDATA[All the rage going around is how fitting it is for Baz not to win his final toss. His record is shambolic with those, winning a mere 12 out of 31. Nonetheless, here is New Zealand's big test. To be facing the worst batting conditions against a brand new cherry which will be darting around early morning.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, BJ Watling(w), Matt Henry, Tim Southee, Neil Wagner, Trent Boult]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b> (Playing XI): Joe Burns, David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), Adam Voges, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill(w), James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird]]></line><line><![CDATA[On expected lines, New Zealand have gone in for an all-pace attack here, choosing Neil Wagner over Mark Craig. The other change is in the form of Matt Henry coming in for the injured Doug Bracewell. For Australia, the only change is Pattinson for Siddle.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia have won the toss and have opted to field</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[There are a few team changes beckoning owing to injury. Peter Siddle pulled up with back spasms at Wellington which were enough to rule him out of this one. James Pattinson is fit and bowling well in the nets, in the words of skipper Steven Smith so he will be drafted in most likely. New Zealand have a man down as well from the Basin Reserve. Doug Bracewell appeared to have done some mischief to his shoulder, which dovetails him to the injured list of Ross Taylor and Mitchell Santner. However, no replacement has been called upon as the Kiwis already possess Matt Henry and Neil Wagner in their squad. Expect the former to be in the XI with his added pace.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Okay right. We have a Test match on our hands. After Australia ran away with the first one, it has got them to the threshold of a rare away series win in recent times. A win which will also see them clinch the much-prized Test Championship Mace. All they need is a draw. But they are the Aussies. They don't think that way. And a draw is highly unlikely given the nature of the pitch here.]]></line><line><![CDATA[As a cricket fan, all I feel today is an overwhelming emotion of gratitude. I am grateful. Grateful for all the times Baz put his body on the line near the ropes to save a meagre run. Grateful for his breakneck and sometimes reckless batting. Grateful for all those moments of exhilararation which were palpable when a bowler stood at the top of his mark not knowing what is about to happen. Just grateful.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>08:30 Local Time, 20:30 GMT, 02:00 IST:</b> Hear them? Listen carefully. The chimes of destruction. Impending doom. Every time a bowler stood at the top of his mark to bowl to Brendon McCullum, he could hear it. And now they are fading. Fading as we prepare to embark on McCullum's swansong. Well, for all we know, he might just come out and make those metals explode and dash off into the sunset. In what will be his 101st consecutive Test since debut, and final one, New Zealand seek retribution and parity to deny Australia the No. 1 Test ranking. So let's hold onto our seats and witness the majesty of Baz entering his final sprint, as will the packed house at Hagley Oval.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b> (From): David Warner, Joe Burns, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), Adam Voges, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill(w), James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird, Shaun Marsh, Chadd Sayers]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, BJ Watling(w), Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Neil Wagner, Trent Boult, Mark Craig, Luke Ronchi]]></line>
