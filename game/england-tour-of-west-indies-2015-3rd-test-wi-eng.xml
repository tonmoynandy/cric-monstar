			<line><![CDATA[That brings us to the end of our coverage of the Test series between West Indies and England. Hope you enjoyed following it here. Until next time, this is <b>Sidhant Maheshwari</b>, signing off on behalf of <b>Krishna</b> and <b>Kaushik</b>.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Cook:</b> 'We came here after Grenada and we had the opportunity to make it 2-0. We did well for the first day and a half. It's a bit of both, 250 wasn't enough in the first innings, probably 300 was par, and then obviously 120 was disappointing. It was a good toss to win. This loss is a tough one to take. Full credit to West Indies for bowling that well and that chase on that pitch was also a great one. When you're defending 190 odd, you need to take every chance, but we didn't do it. Every series we play we want to win, so that is a failure that way. I can't fault the effort from the lads but we were not good enough in the last 20 overs. We weren't good enough to win this Test match. We will take it on the chin. The squad will stay together and for the majority of the series, we did really well but we didn't quite do it well enough.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England retain the Wisden Trophy as the series ended 1-1</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ramdin:</b> 'It was a very tricky one, but it turned out well for us. We lost the toss but the bowlers came out so well for us in this game. The batsmen didn't quite do as well as we wanted in the first innings but young Bravo and Blackwood came out for us today and batted brilliantly. Taylor and the others did extremely well. We knew that we needed to take those early wickets that time and the bowlers did extremely well to take five wickets yesterday. Both teams have played some good cricket. We knew we could beat them and we have shown that today. The youngsters are extremely positive and they want to win. Hopefully, we can keep playing like this.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Anderson:</b> 'We played some good cricket throughout the series. We got the first innings lead here as well, but it didn't work out. We thought that we had a chance when we took a couple of wickets, but they chased it down well. I feel I have contributed to the team's success, but a little disappointed with the loss. For a few of us, it might be the last time we come here if we take another 6 years to come back to West Indies. The English crowd support has been great for us everywhere and we had a great time here.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>James Anderson</b> is the <b>Man of the Series</b> for taking <b>17 wickets</b> in the series]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Blackwood:</b> 'I always try to play my natural game, but it's a different situation everytime I bat. You have to bat according to the situation. I always want to play my natural game and I don't get worried if I get out playing my natural game. It is important to mix my natural game with a bit of defence and it came out really well here. Bravo told me to stay positive and take it 10 runs at a time. With each Test series I am learning and that's a good thing for me.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Jermaine Blackwood</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for scores of <b>85</b> and <b>47*</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Time for the <b>presentation ceremony</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[By virtue of their win, West Indies denied England an away series win, a feat that has eluded them since their historic win in India in late 2012. They now head to a grueling summer of Test cricket at home where they'll host New Zealand before welcoming the Aussies for the all-important Ashes. For a young West Indies side that was pummeled on its tour to South Africa, a result like this couldn't have come at a better time. Ramdin and Co. can take heart from this performance and build on it. For Cook and Moores though, it's back to the drawing board. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Match Recap:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Coming to the opening days of the Test, England had it all going their way to complete the series win. Alastair Cook broke a sequence of 35 Test innings without a ton with a patient 105 but besides a half-century from Moeen Ali, England failed to get sizable contributions from the rest and got just 257 in the first innings. Another virtuoso performance from James Anderson (6 for 42), his 17th five-wicket haul in Tests, helped them eke out a 68-run lead before West Indies capped off a memorable 18-wicket Day 2 by removing half of the English batting line-up for next to nothing. Taylor, Holder and Permaul then finished with three wickets apiece on the third morning as England folded for a paltry 123 in their second essay. On a track that offered enough assistance, defending a target of 192 still required a strong bowling performance from Anderson and company. Bravo and Blackwood though had other plans and their famous partnership helped West Indies cruise to a series-levelling win.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Day 3 summary:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[In retrospect it was England who enjoyed a brighter start to Day 3. Resuming on their overnight lead of 107, they added 51 runs in the first hour before Permaul, Holder and Taylor conspired to trigger a collapse. Despite a flourish from Jos Buttler, England were bowled out for 123 in their second innings thereby setting a target of 192. West Indies had never lost a Test chasing under 200 and they set about the chase in a positive manner. Despite losing early wickets, Darren Bravo (82) and Jermaine Blackwood's (47*) match-winning stand helped the hosts seal a famous Test match win.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Session summary:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Bravo started the final session in emphatic fashion by hitting Joe Root for a six and a four before the lull set in. Chanderpaul played on to an Anderson loosener before Blackwood and Bravo showed immense caution against the English attack for the next half an hour. The duo complemented each other and batted extremely well as Alastair Cook kept ringing in changes. While Bravo was enticed occasionally into playing a false shot, his 23-year old partner remained largely nonplussed. Bravo registered his 11th Test fifty in typically wristy fashion and in the process completed the fifty run stand between the two. He was dismissed finally for a superb 82, just four runs short of the win but Blackwood remained unbeaten and took his side home.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Darren Bravo and Jermaine Blackwood sealed a remarkable turnaround for the West Indies with a <b>series levelling 108-run stand</b> as West Indies came back from conceding a 68-run first innings lead to record a 5-wicket win.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Blackwood is extremely delighted after hitting the winning runs. He punches the air in delight. Ramdin hugs him and the English players congratulate Blackwood and Ramdin. The West Indians also walk out to shake hands with the Englishmen.]]></line><line><![CDATA[62.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moeen Ali to Blackwood, <b>FOUR</b>, that's it! <b>West Indies win by 5 wickets, a historic win for the men from the Caribbean</b>. <b>The series ends 1-1</b>. England continue to chase an away series win in Tests.

Bravo is livid with himself for throwing it away right before the end. Blackwood pats him on the back as he makes his way back to the pavilion. He waves his bat to the crowd, who continue to applaud his effort. Coming back to the ball, it was a low full toss outside off, Bravo wanted to go over mid-off but doesn't get the desired elevation. Broad moves to his right, jumps high and takes the catch. <b>Darren Bravo c Broad b Stokes 82(148) [4s-7 6s-3]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Stokes to Darren Bravo, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[61.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stokes to Darren Bravo, 2 runs, length delivery on off, Bravo goes for the lofted drive, doesn't connect too well but gets it over cover, the fielder from cover runs after it, hauls the ball back in before the rope to save two runs]]></line><line><![CDATA[61.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stokes to Darren Bravo, <b>FOUR</b>, wristy work from Bravo and he collects another four for that, it was full and on middle stump line, Bravo whips it wristily over mid-wicket and the ball runs away to the fence]]></line><line><![CDATA[61.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stokes to Darren Bravo, no run, just short of a good length and on middle stump line, Bravo steers it towards backward point, shouts a loud 'No' for the single]]></line><line><![CDATA[61.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stokes to Darren Bravo, 2 runs, short of length delivery around off, Bravo hops inside the crease, opens the face of the bat and guides it to the right of backward point, the batsmen come back for the second before the ball is hunted down]]></line><line><![CDATA[61.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stokes to Blackwood, 1 run, <b>100-run partnership comes up with this single</b>.

Eventually, one such ball consumed Chris Jordan, who tickled it to the keeper. Gabriel and Taylor then peppered Stuart Broad with a barrage of short deliveries.

West Indies had the last laugh yesterday as they were able to take 7 English wickets. They'll now be hoping to take the final three wickets, bowling England out for a modest total.

Cook was ecstatic after reaching his ton, but his happiness was short-lived as he soon got out, that too in the final over of the day. Cook's reaction after his fall though trumped his celebrations after his century as he stood his ground in disbelief momentarily.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Until tomorrow, this is <b>Sidhant Maheshwari</b>, signing off on behalf of <b>Bhanu</b> and <b>Kaushik</b>.

Jason Holder then dispelled doubts about his fitness with two important wickets. First, he uprooted Gary Ballance's middle-stump and then induced an indeterminate prod from new batsman Ian Bell with a slower delivery to take a sharp catch off his own bowling. In-form batsman Joe Root and Cook added 53 for the fourth wicket before the former fell straight after lunch to Permaul. Cook and Ali then got together for a 98-run union, before Ali was run out as Cook went for a non-existent single. Alastair Cook's dismissal in the final over has given West Indies the edge at the end of Day 1. Can they drive home the advantage by bowling England out quickly on the second day? Join us tomorrow to find out.]]></line><line><![CDATA[In the final session, Denesh Ramdin inexplicably preferred to bowl his spinners in tandem and allowed Moeen Ali and Cook to milk the bowling by setting defensive fields. By the time Jerome Taylor returned to the attack, Ali had completed his half-century and was able to pick off the pacer's variations with ease. Cook handled Taylor's strategy of bowling full and wide outside off-stump with elan. The duo added 98 for the fifth wicket before a run-out ended Moeen's stay at the crease. Even after Moeen fell, Cook continued to battle away along with Ben Stokes and helped England cross the 200-run mark. Holder and Gabriel bowling with the second new ball toiled hard and the latter was rewarded for his persistence when Stokes played one away from his body and was caught at gully with just four overs left to play in the day. Samuels had Cook in the final over of the day to give West Indies the first day honours.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Alastair Cook battled his way to a Test century, his 26th.

James Anderson was the hero for England as he was involved in all the six wickets that fell in the first session of the day.

England on the other hand, buoyed by James Anderson's final day heroics in Grenada, are on the cusp of their first away series win since India in 2012 as they prepare for a gruelling summer of cricket at home that culminates with the all-important Ashes.<br/><br/>While the hosts will bank on the historically lively surface at the Kensington Oval, once a fortress for them, to help turn positive performances into meaningful results, England have the added incentive of sealing a series win that eluded them the last time they toured the Caribbean in 2009.<br/><br/>Start date: May 1, 2015<br/><br/>Venue: Kensington Oval, Barbados<br/><br/>Weather: Mostly Sunny with a 20% chance of rain on the opening day<br/><br/>Team News:<br/><br/>West Indies<br/><br/>Contrary to popular expectation, West Indies' batting has held its own against a formidable England attack. With as many as four centurions in two Tests - Jermaine Blackwood, Jason Holder, Marlon Samuels and Kraigg Brathwaite - the hosts have ticked most boxes on the batting front. The team management, however, will be sweating on the fitness of key bowlers Jerome Taylor and Holder. Taylor, who missed the second Test due to injury, is expected to return, but in the event of Holder failing to adequately recover from his injury sustained in Grenada, Shannon Gabriel will hold on to his place. Devendra Bishoo, who is carrying a niggle may be replaced by Veerasamy Permaul for the lone spinner's role.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Kraigg Brathwaite, 2 Devon Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Marlon Samuels, 5 Shivnarine Chanderpaul 6 Jermaine Blackwood, 7 Denesh Ramdin(capt/wk), 8 Jason Holder/Jerome Taylor, 9 Kemar Roach, 10 Devendra Bishoo/ Veerasamy Permaul, 11 Shannon Gabriel<br/><br/>England<br/><br/>England, who are scheduled to play many Tests in the next 12 months, will have player workload management at the top of their agenda. But, with an away series win at stake, possibilities of sweeping changes to the side appear minimal unless enforced. A fifty in the last Test may just have given Jonathan Trott another Test cap while Moeen Ali is likely to retain his place as England look to beef up their batting, which would keep James Tredwell out for a second consecutive Test despite putting in an impressive performance in Antigua.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Alastair Cook (capt), 2 Jonathan Trott, 3 Gary Ballance, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Joe Root, 6 Moeen Ali/James Tredwell, 7 Ben Stokes, 8 Jos Butler (wk), 9 Chris Jordan, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James Anderson<br/><br/>Statistics:<br/><br/>- Shivnarine Chanderpaul needs 71 runs to overtake Brian Lara as the leading run-scorer for West Indies in Test cricket.<br/><br/>- With 324 runs in three innings at a staggering average of 162, Joe Root tops the batting charts in the series.<br/><br/>Quotes:<br/><br/>"He's the glue that holds the England Team together"<br/><br/>- Ben Stokes received rich praise from West Indies coach Phil Simmons<br/><br/>"I still feel there's a lot more of my batting to come"<br/><br/>- Moeen Ali believes he hasn't justified his batting talent in the long format]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>West Indies</b> (From): Kraigg Brathwaite, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Jermaine Blackwood, Denesh Ramdin(c/w), Jason Holder, Jerome Taylor, Veerasammy Permaul, Shannon Gabriel, Kemar Roach, Shai Hope, Carlos Brathwaite]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England</b> (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Adam Lyth, Jonathan Bairstow, Liam Plunkett, Mark Wood, Adil Rashid, James Tredwell]]></line>
