			<line><![CDATA[Pakistan are just 105 runs behind Bangladesh's first innings total and the hosts need to play very well tomorrow to get back into this contest. That concludes proceedings for today. Join us back tomorrow for all the action from Day 3. Goodbye!]]></line><line><![CDATA[In reply, openers Mohammad Hafeez and Sami Aslam shared a fifty partnership before the latter was dismissed. Since then, Hafeez and Azhar Ali batted sensibly to put Pakistan in command. Hafeez recorded his 8th Test hundred - his 3rd in four innings - and also became the third Pakistani opener to amass 500 runs in 5 consecutive innings. Bangladesh dropped Azhar Ali twice and he is now looking strong after registering his 19th Test fifty.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stumps, Day 2</b>: Pakistan have had a great day in the office and they now have the upper hand in this Test match. Firstly, the bowlers bowled well in the morning session to pick wickets at regular intervals. Soon after the lunch break, Bangladesh were bowled out for 332. The hosts lost their last 7 wickets for just 96 runs as Wahab Riaz and Yasir Shah bagged two wickets apiece.]]></line><line><![CDATA[57.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubel to Azhar Ali, no run, bouncer outside off stump, Ali ducks under it]]></line><line><![CDATA[57.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubel to Azhar Ali, <b>no ball</b>, oopsy!

Bangladesh did not get off to the best of starts as Shakib Al Hasan played an uncharacteristic stroke to gift his wicket away to Zulfiqar Babar very early in the day. Debutant Soumya Sarkar then joined Mushfiqur Rahim and played positively. With the duo sharing a fifty partnership, Bangladesh looked all set to post a big first innings total but Asad Shafiq took an excellent catch to get rid of the latter. Yasir Shah then foxed Rahim with a big leg-spinner before knocking over Taijul Islam with a googly. Pakistan's fielding was much improved and the team management would be happy with their performance. Can the tailenders help Bangladesh get past 350?

The morning session is going to be crucial for both teams. Pakistan need some early wickets  to stop Bangladesh from getting a big first innings total. On the other hand, the hosts would want to bat well and score in excess of 400. Mominul Haque was the star performer with the bat for Bangladesh. He was dismissed against the run of play in the last over of the day yesterday. Pakistan's fielding was not up to the mark and the bowlers certainly need some help from the fielders as there is not much of assistance from the pitch.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Mominul continued and recorded his 8th Test fifty. In the process, he became only the 7th player to record 50+ scores in 10 consecutive Test matches. Just when it looked like Bangladesh had their noses slightly ahead, Zulfiqar Babar trapped Mominul plumb in front in the final over of the day to hurt the hosts. For Pakistan, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Hafeez, Yasir Shah and Babar bagged a wicket each. The visitors dropped a few chances and they would want to improve their fielding. So that concludes proceedings. Join us back tomorrow for all the action from Day 2. Goodbye!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Opting to bat first, the hosts got off to a sedate start as the Pakistani pacers bowled a tight line. Yasir Shah came on and accounted for Tamim Iqbal in his second over. Mominul Haque and Imrul Kayes then batted sensibly to help Bangladesh get to 60/1 at lunch. Resuming after the break, the duo upped the ante but the latter fell soon after completing his 2nd Test fifty. Mahmudullah then joined Mominul and the duo were involved in a 95-run stand before the former fell one run short of a fifty.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stumps, Day 1</b>: 236/3 would have been better for Bangladesh, but they will take 236/4. Pakistan would have wanted a few more wickets, but they can be happy with the fact that they have not allowed Bangladesh to score freely. So it's all evenly balanced at the moment.]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babar to Mominul, <b>out</b> Lbw!! What a time to get a wicket. Mominul can't believe that he's been dismissed. Flighted delivery from Babar, Mominul looks to defend, but the ball spins sharply and goes past the bat. Hits him in line with middle and off and that looked absolutely plumb. Umpire Nigel Llong had no hesitation in his mind and he put his finger up in a flash. End of a gritty knock from the little man. He falls short of a well deserved hundred. <b>Mominul lbw b Babar 80(162) [4s-8]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Babar to Mominul, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Lbw!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Mominul has been given OUT LBW, he consults with his partner and decides to review.
