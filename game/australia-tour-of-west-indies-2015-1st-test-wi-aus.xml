			<line><![CDATA[That brings an end to the proceedings. There is a small break in cricket as there are no international matches for the next three days. However, we will be back on Tuesday for the first ODI between England and New Zealand. Do join us for that game. Until then, take care and Cya!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Clarke:</b> "Tough fight today. I thought West Indies fought exceptionally hard. And credit to our bowlers. They found a way to take wickets on a wicket that was really slow and hard work for the fast bowlers. West Indies deserve a lot of credit, but our bowlers just stuck at it, nice and patient. The fielding throughout the game was really good and with the way Warner and Marsh went about the chase, is the way we like to play cricket. We need to be aggressive in the second Test as well. He (Voges) is a class act. He deserved this opportunity, he has put runs on the board. He rightfully deserves that opportunity, and with his maturity and experience showed that he grabbed it with both hands."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ramdin:</b> "It was tough and we knew they were going to come at us all the time. We were disappointed with our first innings total, but young Dowrich showed the character which everyone should have shown. Samuels batted well, but didn't carry on and we kept losing wickets consistently. If we had scored a big score in the first innings, it would have set-up the match. Adam Voges batted really well for them and set it up. Bishoo was fantastic, he kept bowling great deliveries and magical deliveries. Well done to him, didn't get the opportunity to bowl in the second innings. Hopefully, in Jamaica he will do well. We know we can bowl them out, they are a very good batting unit."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Voges:</b> "It has been a perfect 3 days. To get a chance to play for Australia was a great moment. It was an all-round effort. The boys did well to restrict them and then the tailenders supported me."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Adam Voges</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia came out with sheer intent to finish the game off in a hurry. Warner started off in belligerent fashion, smacking the bowlers all around the park, before he edged one off Taylor when Australia were 5 shy of their target. Smith came out and made sure that there were no more hiccups. Not to forget, Australia's fielding was exceptional in this game. They took all the half chances and made sure that West Indies were always chasing the leather.]]></line><line><![CDATA[West Indies started poorly in the second innings as well. Johnson and Starc sent both openers off consecutive balls to put them in a spot of bother. At stumps on day 2, West Indies were 25/2. They didn't start well today as well as they lost Darren Bravo early. Dowrich and Samuels though played with great composure and got together for a 144-run union, frustrating the Australian bowlers. However, Dowrich's wicket opened the floodgates and West Indies lost their last 7 wickets for a paltry 35 runs, giving Australia a target of 47 runs to go 1-0 up in the series.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Watson and Haddin too didn't last long, leaving Australia at 126/6 at that point. Voges though played a brilliant knock and along with the tail, he batted sensibly to extend Australia's lead. In that process, he went on to score his maiden Test ton on his debut, becoming the oldest player to achieve this feat. The last 4 Australian wickets yielded 198 runs. Voges remained unbeaten and Australia finished their innings on 318, taking a lead of 170 runs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia though didn't start well with the bat either. After they lost Warner early, Marsh and Smith tried to stitch a partnership, before Marsh went edging Holder to first slip. Clarke too didn't bat for long and it was left for Smith and the debutant Voges to bail them out when Australia were struggling at 61/3. Smith though never looked comfortable and got out on the morning of the second day. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[After winning the toss, West Indies were going at a decent pace when they were 63/1, with Shai Hope and Darren Bravo at the crease. However, the Australian bowlers came back superbly and combined with some poor shots, West Indies lost their last 9 wickets for 85 runs. Hazlewood was the pick of the Australian bowlers as he snaffled 3 wickets. He was well supported by Johnson and Starc, who took 5 wickets between them.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to S Smith, 1 run, <b>Australia win by 9 wickets.</b> Fullish and on the stumps, Smith leans forward and clips it past the diving mid-wicket fielder. Both batsmen shake hands with the West Indian players. Smith and Marsh congratulate each other as they walk back to the pavilion. Warner, who had got out was near the rope applauding the effort.]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to S Smith, no run, back of a length close to off, Smith moves across and turns it to mid-wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to S Smith, no run, good length ball on off, Smith shuffles across and knocks it to mid-wicket, Marsh was halfway down the wicket before being sent back, he makes it back in time and even the throw was off target]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to S Smith, <b>FOUR</b>, seems like even the West Indians want to finish the game off, Taylor drifts one onto Smith's pads, he gets inside the line and glances it fine, no chance for the fine leg fielder to stop that]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Steven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, <b>out</b> Caught by Darren Bravo!! It started to rain and Warner was in a hurry. But he has done his job, Australia are one hit away from sealing the game. The full delivery outside off, he rolled his fingers over the ball, Warner threw the kitchen sink at it, the outside edge went at a comfortable height to Bravo at first slip. <b>Warner c Darren Bravo b Jerome Taylor 28(20) [4s-3 6s-2]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Jerome Taylor to Warner, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, yorker length outside off, Warner squeezes it to backward point]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, 1 run, full and angling into Warner, who goes for a mighty heave across the line, drags it off the inner part to deep square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, <b>FOUR</b>, crunched! With the groundsmen getting ready with the covers, Warner wants to finish it in a hurry. On a length just outside off, driven on-the-up through extra cover, the ball reached the fence in a jiffy]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to S Marsh, 3 runs, overpitched up on off and middle, Marsh drives it uppishly between extra cover and mid-off, Samuels gives chase and can't prevent the batsmen from taking three]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to S Marsh, <b>FOUR</b>, another beautiful shot! Marsh played a couple of these in the first innings as well, pitched up outside off, Marsh leans forward and creams the drive wide of mid-off, the timing takes it to the fence]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to S Marsh, no run, yorker on off, Marsh digs it back to the bowler]]></line><line><![CDATA[3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to S Marsh, <b>FOUR</b>, glorious shot! Full and slanting into the batsman, Marsh presents the full face of the bat and drives it past Warner, mid-on was square and had no chance of stopping that]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, hit the seam and shaped away, Warner went for the extravagant cover drive, fails to connect. There was a stifled appeal for caught behind, but it was long way away from the bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, <b>FOUR</b>, cracking shot! Short and plenty of room on offer, Warner stays back and cuts it in front of square, none of the fielders on the off-side moved once the ball made contact with the bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, on a length close to off, defended off the front foot to mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, shortish and outside off, Warner looks to slap it through the off-side, mishits it to mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, fuller and around off, Warner leans forward and pushes it to cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, Taylor comes round the wicket, bowls a shooter, keeps low and sneaks under Warner's bat, luckily it was not on the stumps]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, 1 run, full and drifting into the pads, Warner leans forward and flicks to deep square leg, retains strike]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, <b>SIX</b>, the West Indian bowlers keep bowling it short and Warner keeps dispatching it away. Way too short from Gabriel, Warner rocks back and pulls it over cow corner, the ball cleared the rope with ease]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, no run, fuller and close to off, Warner presses it to mid-off after coming forward]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, no run, shortish and around off, Warner looks to play the short-arm pull, mistimes it to mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, <b>no ball</b>, Gabriel oversteps, keeps it back of a length and gets it to hold its line, Warner is opened up slightly as he squirts it off the outer half of the bat to point]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to Warner, no run, tucks the batsman for room with this short of length delivery, Warner knocks it to point]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Gabriel to S Marsh, 1 run, starts from round the wicket, angles it into the batsman, Marsh gets inside the line and tucks it to fine leg, back to Warner now]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Shannon Gabriel, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, 2 runs, again, the length is short from Taylor. The line is outside off, Warner goes back and punches in the air through the unmanned cover region, Blackwood gives chase and keeps it to a brace]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, no run, Warner missed out there, short and plenty of width on offer, he goes for the cut and chops it to mid-off, it came off the toe-end]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, <b>SIX</b>, there he goes again. Banged in halfway down the wicket, not much pace to trouble Warner, he transfers his weight onto the back foot and pulls it in front of square. That came right off the meat as the ball sailed over the rope]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to Warner, <b>FOUR</b>, Warner is not going to hang around, if the ball is there, he is going to play his shots, back of a length just outside off, Warner goes back and punches through the vacant cover region]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to S Marsh, 1 run, quick call for a run and Warner makes it with ease. This one straightens around off, Marsh brings his bat down at an angle, it squirts off the inside edge to square leg, Warner calls for the run and makes it in even though there is a direct hit]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome Taylor to S Marsh, no run, some movement for Taylor, nips back in from short of length, Marsh makes a late call of playing that, ekes out an inside edge onto the pad, the ball rolls towards point]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>S Marsh and Warner are at the crease. S Marsh is on strike. Jerome Taylor will open the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Hello again.. Australia need 47 runs. Warner and Marsh out in the middle. Taylor to open the attack.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Australian team is extremely happy and why not. The target for them now is just 47 runs and they should be able to chase this down today. When West Indies lost two early wickets yesterday, it looked like they were in serious trouble, but Dowrich and Samuels shared an excellent 144-run stand for the third wicket to lift the mood in the dressing room. However, once the stand was broken, the hosts lost the plot and Australia were able to take wickets at regular intervals. Starc was the pick of the bowlers as he took four wickets, while Hazlewood, Johnson and Lyon bagged two each. Take a short break and join us back in a short while for the Australian reply...]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to S Gabriel, <b>out</b> Bowled!! Take a bow Mitchell Starc. Lovely inswinging yorker, too good for a lower-order batsman, Gabriel doesn't get behind the line of this ball, swings across the line and misses. The ball hits the boot and then the leg stump. Starc ends with four wickets. <b>S Gabriel b Starc 0(1)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Starc to S Gabriel, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Bowled!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Shannon Gabriel, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to Devendra Bishoo, <b>out</b> Bowled!!

Johnson and Starc sent both openers off consecutive balls to leave West Indies in a spot of bother.

Live action follows in a short while. Stay tuned.]]></line><line><![CDATA[West Indies managed to bowl Australia out, but they were very disappointed with themselves towards the end of the Australian innings. The lack of a celebration after taking the final Aussie wicket, implied how frustrated they were. West Indies were made to bat for a total of 11 overs before stumps, a tricky period that they would have ideally wanted to bat through without much fuss.]]></line><line><![CDATA[However, debutant Adam Voges and the lower-order had other plans. Voges continued to bat solidly and was given good support by Johnson, Lyon and Hazlewood. With the tailenders doing well, Voges played his natural game and went on to register his maiden Test hundred, becoming the oldest debutant to hit a century. The last two wickets for Australia yielded a monumental 140 runs, helping them take a lead of 170.]]></line><line><![CDATA[With just two days gone, we have already witnessed so much action in this Test match. The match has progressed at a rapid pace and currently, West Indies are battling to try and save this game.

They now trail Australia by 145 runs and will have to play extremely well in the morning session on Day 3 to avoid an innings defeat. Meanwhile, Australia will back themselves to begin well tomorrow as the pitch is offering some assistance to the bowlers. That's it from us on Day 2. Join us back at <b>10:00 local</b> tomorrow for all the action from the third day. Goodbye!]]></line><line><![CDATA[After the lunch break, Bishoo came back to remove Johnson and Mitchell Starc in quick succession, but Voges was able to form another handy partnership, this time with Nathan Lyon. Josh Hazlewood then showed great application and was determined to give good support to Voges, who farmed the strike and took the attack to the bowlers. A while later, as the partnership blossomed, Voges became the oldest player overall to record a Test hundred on debut. Soon Hazlewood too upped the ante to extend the lead past 150 before being knocked over by Marlon Samuels. In the end, Australia managed to add 140 runs for the last two wickets.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stumps, Day 2</b>: Although West Indies began the day on a positive note, they lost their way and Adam Voges led a brilliant recovery to help Australia gain a very good first innings lead. Steve Smith and Adam Voges started off on a cautious note, but a tight spell from Devendra Bishoo forced Smith to attempt a big shot and was stumped by a long way. With a bit of assistance from the pitch, Bishoo generated good amount of turn and had Shane Watson caught at second slip. When he knocked over Brad Haddin with a peach - the ball pitched almost outside leg stump and turned square to hit the top of off stump - it looked like West Indies would keep the visitors in check, but Mitchell Johnson played sensibly and shared a fifty partnership with Voges to steady things.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, on a good length and in that channel outside off, Bravo shuffles across and defends it]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Last ball of the day</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, short of a length and going away with the angle, Bravo gets his bat and gloves out of the way as he lets it go]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, short of a good length and angling across the left-hander, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, nicely bowled by Hazlewood, gets this one to nip away after hitting the deck, Bravo is slightly squared up and is hit high on the back pad]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, Hazlewood shortens his length outside off, driven back towards the bowler]]></line><line><![CDATA[10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, fuller length delivery and shaping away from outside off, left alone]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[9.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon to Dowrich, no run, tossed up and on the stumps, Dowrich goes back and defends it with a straight bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[Lyon changes to round the wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon to Dowrich, no run, Lyon drifts one on the stumps, Dowrich watches it all along and blocks]]></line><line><![CDATA[9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon to Dowrich, no run, this one is given more air, Dowrich lunges forward and blocks]]></line><line><![CDATA[9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon to Dowrich, no run, flighted delivery and on the leg-stump line, Dowrich goes back and blocks]]></line><line><![CDATA[9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyon to Dowrich, no run, tossed up and on the stumps, defended with a straight bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[A slip, leg slip, FSL and a shortish mid-wicket in place.

They kept it tight and picked up a wicket each as well. Bishoo, though he was expensive, snaffled the big wicket of Clarke.

The pitch has something in it for everyone and that should keep them interested.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stumps, Day 1:</b> West Indies have done well to stay in the game. Taylor was very impressive with the new ball, he bowled in the right areas and was aided by the pitch as well to get rid of Warner.

Johnson will spearhead the attack as Ryan Harris has been rested ahead of the Ashes. It will be interesting to see if the visitors opt to play two spinners as the last time these two sides met here, the spinners took 26 off the 40 wickets. However, the word is that this track has a little more grass and it is highly likely that Australia will go in with three seamers.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Australia, who are returning to Test cricket since their 2-0 series win over India, will make use of this opportunity to fine tune their skills before the Ashes next month. Michael Clarke and Co. have played some impressive cricket of late and will be looking for some momentum early on in the series. With regular opener Chris Rogers being ruled out of the first Test after being hit in the nets, Shaun Marsh, who hit a hundred in the tour match is expected to take his place.]]></line><line><![CDATA[After the drawn series (1-1) with England, the hosts have made a few changes to their squad and the biggest being the axing of veteran batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who has been dropped for the first time in 21 years. This means the squad has only two players, who have played more than 50 Test matches. The selectors have named a couple of fresh faces in Rajindra Chandrika and Shane Dowrich. Having scored fifties in both the innings of the warm-up game against Australia, Dowrich is almost a certainty in the side.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Hello and welcome for another day of Test match cricket. It's hosts West Indies taking on the second ranked Test team currently, Australia, in the first of the 2-match Test series. Australia wouldn't mind starting the series in Dominica as they beat West Indies by 75 runs the last time they played here. However, West Indies are fresh from a fantastic win against England in Barbados and will be confident of getting off to a good start in this short series.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview:</b><br/><br/>Australia begin their Ashes tune-up with a short trip to the Caribbean where they take on a West Indies side, who following their positive show against England last month (drawn 1-1), would like to believe they are on their way up in the Test circuit. Playing Australia in any format can be a daunting proposition, especially considering the kind of form Michael Clarke's men exhibited over the summer starting with the Test series win against India and culminating with a fifth World Cup triumph.<br/><br/>West Indies have done an England in terms of selection issues overshadowing all else in the build up to a series. The exclusion of talisman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has divided opinion among the West Indian cricketing fraternity and the players will only be happier to get on the field to drown out the noise from the stands. They come into the series on the back of a famous win in Barbados against England and should carry good vibes going into the series.<br/><br/>For Australia, who return to red-ball cricket for the first time since the New Year's Test in Sydney, it is about getting the process and the mindset right again. Barring Shaun Marsh's hundred and Josh Hazlewood's bowling performance, they were well off their pace in the only warm-up game against the Board President's XI in Antigua. But all that should change once the real game starts when the World Cup hangover can no longer serve as an excuse.<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Windsor Park, Roseau, Dominica<br/><b>Date:</b> June 3, 2015<br/><b>Time:</b> 14:00 GMT; 19:30 IST<br/><b>Weather:</b> Bright and sunny with a high of 28 degree Celsius.<br/><br/><b>Team News:</b><br/><br/><b>West Indies:</b><br/><br/>With an experience built over 164 Tests taken out of the picture, the onus of shouldering West Indies' batting falls on the hot and cold Marlon Samuels. Captain Denesh Ramdin too hasn't had fortuitous time with the bat and will be needed to contribute substantially if the hosts are to stay abreast with Australia's challenge. Shai Hope returned scores of 5 and 9 in his debut in Barbados but the selectors have retained him in the squad and should open the batting with Kraigg Brathwaite while Chanderpaul's place is likely to be taken by Shane Dowrich who has enjoyed a fruitful First Class season behind him while he also scored half-centuries in both innings in the warm-up game.<br/><br/>Probable XI: Kraigg Brathwaite, Shai Hope/Rajindra Chandrika, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich, Denesh Ramdin (c & wk), Jason Holder, Veerasammy Permaul/Devendra Bishoo, Jerome Taylor, Shanon Gabriel/Kemar Roach.<br/><br/><b>Australia:</b><br/><br/>Two things are certain, in-form Steve Smith will bat at No.3 for Australia while Shaun Marsh will partner David Warner at the top of the order after regular opener Chris Rogers was ruled out of the first Test after getting hit in the nets. Michael Clarke confirmed the same in his pre-match conference. The nature of the pitch, still a mystery, is likely to determine their final playing composition. Should the surface be conducive to spin as it is historically known to be, Australia could consider handing spinner Fawad Ahmed a Test debut and play him alongside Nathan Lyon.<br/><br/>Probable XI: David Warner, Shaun Marsh, Steve Smith, Michael Clarke (c), Shane Watson, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin (wk), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.<br/><br/><b>Stats and Trivia:</b><br/><br/>- Spinners took 26 off the 40 wickets the last time these two sides played in Dominica in 2012 (Australia won by 75 runs)<br/><br/>- Australia lead West Indies by 41 wins to 30 over their 96 meetings in Tests<br/><br/><b>Quotes:</b><br/><br/>"I think there's still a lot unknown; it's still quite wet, they are watering it a few times a day, so it looks very different to the two we've trained on."<br/><br/>- <b>Michael Clarke</b>, appeared nonplussed about the greenish nature of the match wicket two days before the start of the Test.<br/><br/>"Australia are ranked No. 2 in the world and that says a lot. We're currently down at eight and need to work our way up. We respect them but we'll be coming in quite hard at them."<br/><br/>- <b>Jason Holder</b> was quietly confident of West Indies continuing the good form shown in the series against England.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>West Indies</b> (From): Kraigg Brathwaite, Shai Hope, Rajindra Chandrika, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Jermaine Blackwood, Denesh Ramdin(c/w), Jason Holder, Shane Dowrich, Jerome Taylor, Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo, Veerasammy Permaul]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Australia</b> (From): David Warner, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Adam Voges, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle, Josh Hazlewood, Fawad Ahmed, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill]]></line>
