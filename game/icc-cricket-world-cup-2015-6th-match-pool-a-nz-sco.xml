			<line><![CDATA[So, that's all we have from this game. Many thanks for your company. Do join us tomorrow for the battle between two Asian nations, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On behalf of <b>Akshay, Pradeep, Sonali, Sriram, Krishna</b> and <b>Bhanu</b>, this is <b>Sidhant</b> signing off. See you tomorrow folks. Take care.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at some of the interesting <b>tweets</b> about this game:<br/><br/><b>Mohandas Menon</b>:  New Zealand won by 3 wkts with 151 balls to spare: this is the narrowest win with most balls to spare in ODI cricket history #NZvSco #CWC15<br/><br/><b>Mazher Arshad</b>: New Zealand's last 10 completed ODIs: W W W W L W W W L W<br/><br/><b>Iain O'Brien</b>: Saying that @CricketScotland have "fought admirably" is doing them a disservice. Theyâ€™ve just gone out there and played cricket.<br/><br/><b>Jamie Alter</b>: A win for NZ, but plenty of concerns with the batting. Well bowled, Scotland. If only the fielding and batting were better #NZvSCO #CWC15<br/><br/><b>Roshan Abeysinghe</b>: NZ may not lose to the Scots but they are definitely wobbling. Great start to the tournament for the 2 associates.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Brendon McCullum:</b> "It was a tough one. Credit to Scotland in the way they hung in there, especially after being four for 12. Lesser teams would have been rolled over there. Credit to them for the way they hung in and managed to post a total which was going to be tricky on that sort of a surface. It was just nibbling enough. And they had the bowlers who could extract a little bit out of it. Pleased with the result at the end. Probably a little bit nervous towards the end. With 25 overs to go, we will take the result and the points from this game. They are world class bowlers (Boult and Southee). They have stood up in red ball cricket for a long time. And as a pair we have seen how effective they can be, with one swinging it away from the right-hander and the other swinging it away from the left-hander. So, they were outstanding. When you win the toss and bowl, you hope to take early wickets. And getting them to 4 for 12 was an outstanding achievement. And also with the way we finished off the innings and after a partnership with a couple of their guys. It was a really good performance in the field and with the ball  and with the bat we showed glimpses. I guess, we need to improve on that. Obviously a different situation, different surface, different ground. It is a day/night game as well (talking about the next game). It is going to be a great challenge and it is nice to have started the competition with two wins. But there is a long way to go in this competition, we know that. And we are just going to keep making small improvements on the way but we are playing some good cricket. England we know, are probably hurting a little bit at the moment. They will turn up and they will be tough to beat over here. So we have to play incredibly well and I believe it's a full house at Wellington. So it should be a great atmosphere. This is certainly the strongest side I have played in (replying to a twitter question asking whether it was the strongest team that McCullum has played in)."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preston Mommsen:</b> "It was a very tough start for us. The ball was doing a little bit more than expected. And to be fair they bowled really well and exploited the conditions. Unfortunately, we lost a few early ones but credit to the way Matthew (Machan) and Richie (Berrington) batted in the middle. I think they showed what we are capable of. Unfortunately they couldn't go on and we were well below par in the target we set. I think when we put the ball in the right areas, we got the rewards. Joshy (Josh Davey) and Wardy (Iain Wardlaw) bowled well for us. Unfortunately we couldn't pick those extra three but I am very proud of the fight in the end there. Great character. We are not shy of the fact that we are a very inexperienced team performing at the World Cup. So, it is good to get the first game out of the way. I am very proud of the performance and now ready for England."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Trent Boult:</b> "I felt pretty good. I thought the ball swung around pretty nicely and I guess wicket had a bit of assistance in it as well. Pretty good bowling performance and everyone had a bit of a bat as well. And we got the job done. I actually slept alright. We got there in the end anyway. And I had a big role to play today. Like I said, everyone played well and we got the job done. The ball did swing for a little bit longer. Like I said the pace was there as well. We didn't really expect that. We just came in and tried to do what we have been doing for the last couple of weeks. And things fell into place and we got the result. It's going well and I am really enjoying the white ball form. A lot more opportunities coming up and need to make most of those."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Trent Boult</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his figures of 2/21 in 6 overs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Black Caps batters looked like they were in a hurry to chase the total down and kept playing their shots even after a wicket had fallen. One can never know if things would have been any different had Scotland not dropped a couple of catches as well. As it turns out, the Kiwis managed to scrape through to a 3-wicket win, but it was not a convincing one. Davey and Wardlaw both finished with 3 wickets for Scotland.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier, Scotland got off to a disastrous start, losing 4 wickets in under 5 overs. 3 out of those 4 wickets were ducks. However, Machan and Berrington showed resolve and batted sensibly after that. Machan got to his fifty and perished soon after, caught at mid-on, with Brendon McCullum taking a superb catch to end his 97-run stand with Berrington. After Machan got out, the floodgates opened. Anderson picked up his second wicket, dismissing the well-set Berrington on 50. From there on, it was all Vettori, who took the final three wickets to end the Scottish innings on 142. Two of those Vettori wickets came off consecutive balls. Overall, it was the <b>third occasion</b> in the innings, when a bowler had picked <b>2 wickets in 2 balls</b>. First Boult did it, then Southee and finally, Vettori. Five Scottish batsmen got out on ducks and out of those, <b>4 were golden ducks</b>.]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand started the run-chase in superb fashion, with Guptill going hard at the new ball. However, he got out after hitting 4 boundaries and then Brendon McCullum took over the aggressor's role, smashing three boundaries, before he departed as well. The Kiwis were 48/2 at that stage when Taylor joined Williamson at the crease. Both of them then batted sensibly for two overs, before lunch was taken. After lunch, New Zealand came out looking to finish the job quickly, but Taylor soon fell trying to slog one out of the park. Elliott and Williamson then put on a good 40-run partnership but Williamson, who was looking in great touch, got out to Davey in the 18th over. Elliott also departed after making a good looking 29 to leave the Kiwis stuttering at 117/5. Anderson was dropped by Wardlaw on 5, but failed to cash in on the reprieve he got. Ronchi also got out soon, trying to play his shots, with the score reading 137/7 at that stage. But, Vettori and Milne made sure that they didn't lose any more wickets and took their team home.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The players shake hands with each other. The New Zealand dressing room looks relieved. The Scotland players walk back solemnly. They did well to ruffle the hosts, defending such a meagre total.]]></line><line><![CDATA[24.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain Wardlaw to Vettori, <b>FOUR</b>, <b>New Zealand win their second game in the tournament</b>! They had to fight hard for it but they have finally crossed the line. It was a length delivery on off, Vettori looks to pull it across the line, closes the bat face early, gets a thick leading edge and the ball flies to the third man fence]]></line><line><![CDATA[24.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain Wardlaw to Milne, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, Milne runs it down to third man with an open bat face, the scores are <b>tied</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[24.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain Wardlaw to Milne, no run, fuller around off, Milne gets forward and taps it to mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[24.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain Wardlaw to Vettori, 1 run, fullish on the pads, Vettori leans forward and clips it to deep square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[24.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain Wardlaw to Vettori, 2 runs, shortish and outside off, Vettori drags the pull to deep mid-wicket, where the fielder runs along the rope to his right and cuts off the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[23.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey to Milne, no run, length delivery on middle and off, Milne blocks it off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[23.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey to Vettori, 1 run, back of a length on leg, Vettori works it off the pads to deep square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Adam Milne, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[23.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey to Ronchi, <b>out</b> Caught by Gardiner!! This is almost comical by New Zealand! It was a shortish ball from Davey, Ronchi gets back and pulls, finds the man at deep mid-wicket to perfection.

Another one goes! New Zealand are just 10 runs away from a win and they are falling down rapidly. Anderson picks this one from his pads and flicks it in the air, ends up top-edging it to fine leg.

He steps out of the crease to his length delivery and looks to hammer it, gets a thick inside edge and the ball goes through to the keeper, who moves to his left to snaffle it. It was dying down on him but Cross does well to hang onto the take.

We are at the University Oval in Dunedin where the hosts entertain Scotland in their second match of the World Cup. The hosts have already started on a winning note, demolishing Sri Lanka in the inaugural match of the tournament. For Preston Mommsen and his merry band of Scottish cricketers, it's an opportunity to prove themselves in front of the global audience.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b><br/><br/>Moments before Preston Mommsen walked in for his final interaction with the media before Scotland's World Cup opener against New Zealand at University Oval on Tuesday, the sound of Scottish bagpipes could be heard coming from one of the adjacent playing fields on the campus of the University of Otago. It must have been part of the university band's practice routines for orientation week - the campus is starting to get active with new arrivals and their parents, as well as returning students - but the sounds of bagpipes was another reminder of where Mommsen's Scotland team are based: Dunedin, known as the Edinburgh of the South, and indeed planned in light of its Scottish predecessor.<br/><br/>Game six of the World Cup pits Scotland against New Zealand, who hammered Sri Lanka by 98 runs in the tournament opener in Christchurch, but Mommsen will be hoping that a bit of Dunedin's Scottish heritage rubs off and motivates his Associates-level team against the in-form home team.<br/><br/>Mommsen was born in South Africa, but today proudly leads Scotland into their third World Cup - after winless runs in 1999 and 2007 - and was confident of the way the team has entered the tournament. "I think we have quite a dynamic side," he said. "Obviously inexperienced in terms of playing on the world stage, but at the same time, I think we can use that to our advantage. Very raw team, so there will be a huge amount of energy there, a huge amount of passion, and the boys will be playing very hard."<br/><br/>Scotland's two warm-ups in Australia resulted in a 179-run win over Ireland and a three-run defeat to West Indies when they were chasing 313, but they will also take a bit of confidence from a practice game against a New Zealand XI featuring Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi, Daniel Vettori, Mitchell McClenaghan and Kyle Mills in Lincoln, last October.<br/><br/>"We watched a video this morning of that game, and we took a huge amount from that game. We took them very close, and really we should have won that game," said Mommsen. "A lot of the guys playing tomorrow played in that game, so we've got that to call upon, and hopefully we can produce a similar performance tomorrow and take the game deep. The buildup has been near perfect for the boys. We're very realistic about the opposition that we're up against. Obviously, New Zealand are a quality team, and the form they are currently in, they're going to be a difficult team to break down. But at the same time, we've prepared as we have for every other game in the leadup to this game tomorrow, and hopefully we can put in a good performance."<br/><br/>Brendon McCullum was part of that game a few months ago, and he too spoke of the team sitting down to watch the video of it. "Yeah, we did some scouting this morning on the bowlers. I've had plenty of footage the last little while that we can get our hands on and I've obviously tried to cover that, as well," he said. :That's one of our big things as a team, that we make sure we go in well planned and well prepared, but they gave us a good run for our money at Lincoln a few months ago. Yeah, we've got to make sure we're on our game and treat it as if we're playing one of the bigger teams, as well, because in this World Cup, I think we've seen at the moment with West Indies under a little bit of pressure, as well, that the Associate teams certainly have players capable of standing up and making things pretty uncomfortable for you."<br/><br/>New Zealand have been a dominant team over the last 15-odd months, winning big series home and away, and this World Cup is being talked of in certain circles as their best shot at victory. Fully aware of the level of competition Scotland are up against, Mommsen sounded confident when assessing his team.<br/><br/>"I don't think we're daunted by the way they play. Obviously, the focus has very much been on the way we want to play our game tomorrow," he said. "At the same time, we know they're dangerous. It's a dangerous lineup from 1 to 11. At the same time, they're still human beings, they still can nick the ball and get caught at slip. We have to put the balls in the right areas and make sure we're able to contain them. Obviously, we can draw on that experience of coming up against West Indies, a very dangerous batting lineup with Chris Gayle, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell towards the deaths, so that was good experience and very recent for us, and we'll call upon that. We're going into this game tomorrow with a huge amount of confidence."<br/><br/>The wicket at University Oval looks a good batting surface, but as both captains said, the angles on a small ground are what could be the deciding factor. While Mommsen felt Scotland would have to play 'smart cricket' on this ground, McCullum harked back to two ODIs played here in January with Sri Lanka, in which New Zealand made 360 and 315.<br/><br/>"Obviously, Australia is a different kettle of fish in terms of their size grounds and things like that, but I think our grounds are really, really good," he said. "They've got some quirks about them, and this one, as well, with the boundaries straight, obviously a little bit shorter, but there's certainly some getout areas, as well, for bowlers with the big boundaries, but I think the pitch looks really good. I'd expect a lot of runs, especially if we get, I guess, some clear skies over here, which I believe is forecast, then I'd expect a lot of runs, I guess, similar to the games we had against Sri Lanka down here."<br/><br/>Hamish Gardiner, who batted at No 3 in the warm-ups and made 12 and 7, could be swapped with Freddie Coleman who batted at one-drop in the UAE last month. The bowling is unlikely to change much from those fixtures, with Scotland heavily dependent on the offspin of 31-year-old Majid Haq - only the second player from the country to cross 200 caps - and medium-pacer Alasdair Evans, with seven wickets in the warm-ups. They will, as Mommsen pointed out, expect a lot from their new-ball pair of Ian Wardlaw and Josh Davey, who earlier this year took ten wickets between them to rout Afghanistan for just 63.<br/><br/>There have been suggestions that New Zealand could make changes for this match, but McCullum dodged that question by saying: "We're going to play our cards pretty close to our chest with the team, but all the guys are fit and available, and it's a good space for us to be in. We've got a fully fit and strong team to pick from, so we'll just work out the strategy that we want to go in with tomorrow."<br/><br/>Probable XIs<br/><br/>New Zealand: 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (capt), 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Grant Elliott, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Tim Southee, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Adam Milne/Mitchell McClenaghan<br/><br/>Scotland: 1 Kyle Coetzer, 2 Callum MacLeod, 3 Hamish Gardiner/Freddie Coleman, 4 Matt Machan, 5 Preston Mommsen (capt), 6 Richie Barrington, 7 Matthew Cross (wk), 8 Josh Davey, 9 Alasdair Evans, 10 Majid Haq, 11 Ian Wardlaw]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Scotland</b> (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Freddie Coleman, Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Preston Mommsen(c), Majid Haq, Rob Taylor, Iain Wardlaw, Safyaan Sharif, Michael Leask, Alasdair Evans]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tom Latham]]></line>
