			<line><![CDATA[Tomorrow is the day - the day when India take on Pakistan in a mouth-watering, saliva-dripping, goose-bump inducing clash at the Adelaide Oval. We'll be there very early for the game. I'm not sure whether I will sleep tonight. Maybe I will, for today's game will force me to take a good rest. So enough for now then. Do join us for that big clash. Until then, it's <b>Srivathsa</b> and <b>Akshay</b> who are signing off from here. It's been a long day, so remember to sleep tight when you can! Adios Amigos!]]></line><line><![CDATA[So that's that then. We've had a superb opening game of the World Cup. It was such a pleasure bringing you the coverage for this game. We've had a ball. Hope you liked it and loved it. The World Cup has just begun and Australia are doing battle with England at the 'G'. Hop tabs to follow all the action. Thanks for all the comments as well. It kept us going.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@holdingwilley:</b> "Kulasekara, the 2nd bowler to start proceedings in a World cup after bowling the last over in the previous one. First was McDermott"]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@sidvee:</b> "Boult bowling yorkers as easily as Indian bowlers bowl long hops"]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@statanalyst:</b> "@BLACKCAPS' record in @cricketworldcup openers: Played - 11 tournaments, Won - 9 of their opening matches, Lost - 2 (1983 & 2003)"]]></line><line><![CDATA[Here are a few tweets related to the game. Some crackers in here. First up is @<b>cricketaakash</b> with this tweet: "NZ has beaten SL for the first time in the last six World Cup meetings...favourites played like one. Bossed the game."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Before we wind up our coverage here are a couple of user comments]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Brendon McCullum:</b> "Yeah, really good performance and when you have such a long wait for this game to finally unfold. You always hope the performances you had leading into will always stack up and today we just continued to play some good cricket and executed our blueprint with the bat. If anything I thought it might swing and that is why we were looking to bowl first if we had won the toss. It was purely overhead conditions, it was an outstanding cricket wicket which had good pace and carry, probably little bit on the slower side. We were able to lay a foundation to then see some of our bigger hitters come in towards the end. Even 330 on the board at half time you are still a bit nervous. Considering how many world class players Sri Lankans have got. We look forward to the next game now. It's great to beat a tough Sri Lankan team. Really pleasing on our ability to use cross seamers today and take the ball off down the fourth and fifth stump line was a deliberate ploy and they used the short ball on this wicket as well. Trent Boult and Adam Milne were touch expensive at the start and the way they came back searching for wickets was the key. This is what we were able to do with those guys. Tim Southee led us again and Daniel Vettori was brilliant as always. A really thorough performance from us. Well certainly he is the closest we have got (on a question asked on Twitter regarding the comparison between Milne and Shane Bond). I think he has a little bit of Bondy's action (Shane Bond) as well. And they both bowled very fast. He is a great weapon to have amongst our team. I can probably confirm that the tweet is probably correct."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Angelo Mathews</b>: "Not really. We knew it was a going to be a good wicket, so we had to bowl pretty well. The bowlers started off very poorly and the bowlers bowled well in the middle part, towards the end we once again didn't bowl pretty well and it was backed up by poor fielding. Especially after the start that they got, they were 100/0 in the 13th over, we did pretty well to pull them back, but I thought we gave 30-40 runs too many. Fortunately while batting we got off to a good start, but once again we lost our way in the middle. Absolutely, when you are chasing 300 plus, you need someone in the top four to try and get a biggie and backed up by good batting in the middle order. Unfortunately, we didn't do it. We are not going to panic, we still have five more games to go and we will keep our heads high and try to win. Of course he (Malinga) will get better and better we all know what kind of a bowler he is and he will come back strong."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Anderson:</b> "It's nice to come back home and play in front of family and friends and I guess a World Cup opener at home is what kids dream of. To do it at Christchurch, at home is a really good feeling. Yeah, there was more nerves than normal, but you play your normal game and you always want to do well for New Zealand. It just happens to be a World Cup and it's a bit more riding on it. I always had a different plan when I tend to walk out to bat. It was nice to build a few partnerships with Grant (Elliott) and Ronchs (Ronchi) and come in and turn that par total into a winning total. It's always nice to start off the World Cup campaign on it. Brendon (McCullum) held me back a little bit for the end and during the powerplay. It was nice to have a little bit of a role. Our other bowlers did an unbelievable job. Dan (Vettori) bowled really well and took them out of the game pretty early. It was a credit to all the bowlers and they took a couple of poles each as well."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Corey Anderson</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, New Zealand batsmen weathered the overcast conditions and saw off the new ball. Brendon McCullum played a blinder at the start and Guptill supported him ably. Fifties from Williamson and Anderson saw the Black Caps post a massive total on the board. Once they scored over 300, the match was almost theirs as they have never lost at home after scoring 300. Do stay with us for a few more minutes as we bring you the presentation...]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand bowlers were exceptional. Boult struggled with the new ball, but came back strongly with the old one. Vettori used his experience to outfox the batsmen and he was well supported by the rest of his mates. Southee was the pick of the bowlers, he got the new cherry to swing and picked up his two wickets at the fag end of the innings. Milne bowled with a lot of pace and troubled the batsmen with it. The fielding as usual was top notch from the hosts.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The only other batsman who showed some sort of application was the Sri Lankan skipper Mathews. He fell four short of his fifty and tried to manufacture a shot as he kept running out of partners. Mahela too didn't trouble the scorers as Vettori snapped him for a duck. The over-reliance on Dilshan, Sangakkara and Mahela was clearly seen in this game, as they fell apart when two of them failed.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The first match of the 2015 World Cup has just finished and as most expected it is New Zealand who have come out on top. The players shake hands and walk off to a standing ovation from their supporters. Sri Lanka started well as the opening pair put on a fifty plus stand. Thirimanne looked in excellent touch as he brought up his 11th ODI fifty. Dilshan struggled before Vettori sent him packing. Sangakkara came out and didn't seem to be in any sort of trouble before Boult came back to nip out both Thiri and Sanga.]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corey Anderson to Herath, <b>out</b> Caught by Milne!! <b>New Zealand thrash Sri Lanka</b>! The first game of the tournament ends and it's the co-hosts who have come out on top. The slower delivery does the trick for Corey Anderson, Herath early into the drive and spoons a catch to cover.

Milne has hit Herath on the helmet! Good to see Milne walk up to Herath and ask him whether he is fine, the batsman nods and all the Kiwis are now checking on him. The helmet is off and he takes a breather. Pacy short delivery, didn't get up, Herath expected it to bounce more and head-butted it to point. That pinged him flush on the badge of the helmet. Herath is a brave man.

His heel was in the air and didn't land, cutting the side crease.

Nonetheless, Mathews opted for spin and Herath answered his call. The left-arm spinner bowled superbly and dragged things back along with Lakmal.

The fielding too was mediocre as there were a couple easy chances that were put down. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[A couple of strikes from Jeevan Mendis put brakes on the scoring rate, but Anderson and Elliott added a crucial 65-run stand for the 5th wicket.

Some tough choices, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tom Latham and Nathan McCullum sit out today. It's a clean slate, we have had a fantastic preparation, we have played some outstanding cricket, had some personnel changes, but our gameplan remains the same. We have some confidence coming into the tournament, it is a clean slate. The tournament starts proper today, we will make sure that we execute our gameplan, if we do that, we will be hard to beat.

So it will be interesting to see what sort of tactics we get to see in this match.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There is an over-reliance on Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews to get them the runs with the bat. While the bowling without Lasith Malinga doesn't pose any threats with due respect to the likes of Kulasekara, Eranga and the others. One good news will be the return of Lasith Malinga. If Malinga is back amongst the wickets and the runs are put on the board by the batters, then we may yet see a different Sri Lankan team.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Sri Lanka on the other hand aren't going into the tournament as one of the favorites. The reason being their recent form hasn't been great. They were whitewashed by India away in a five match ODI series, also losing to New Zealand in the recently concluded ODI series. In between they defeated England at home 5-2 in a seven match series. But Sri Lanka at home are always a different proposition. So one shouldn't read too much into that series against England.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The bowling will be spearheaded by the swing sensations in Tim Southee and Trent Boult with able backup from the experienced Kyle Mills - who may find it difficult to get into the eleven, with the wily old fox Daniel Vettori weaving his magic. They are led by a brilliant strategist in Brendon McCullum and lots of experts including Martin Crowe think that this is their best chance to emerge triumphant after six semi-final appearances. Will they do it remains the big question though.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Just to let everyone know that they will take some stopping, they crushed South Africa by 134 runs in a warm-up game. The runs are flowing from the bats of Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum and down the order they have the dangerous Luke Ronchi and Corey Anderson.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Why are New Zealand hot favorites? This is why. Their last three ODI series have gone like this - they beat Pakistan in the middle east 3-2 in a five match series. Then they thumped Sri Lanka 4-2 at home in a seven match series, before rounding off their World Cup preparations by defeating Pakistan 2-0 in a two match series at home.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Now onto the main action and that is involving New Zealand and Sri Lanka. New Zealand are the form team going into the World Cup and look in great shape at the moment. Their side is led by the inventive and swashbuckling Brendon McCullum and they possess enough firepower in their ranks to go all the way.

Zimbabwe beat Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka lost to South Africa. South Africa lost to New Zealand. Whatever significance has already been attached to these three results in Lincoln and Christchurch this week - Kyle Abbott termed it "amazing" to watch South Africa scrap to a narrow win, JP Duminy said they "weren't fazed" by defeat - is likely to evaporate come February 14 when the 2015 ICC World Cup begins at Hagley Park. The nature of the warm-up game is such that teams tend not to take them too seriously, with the option of fielding all 15 players. But history has shown us that you really cannot read too much into them. In a 2007 World Cup warm-up, India bowled out West Indies for 85 and we all know how that tournament turned out for them.<br/><br/>Game one of the World Cup features the hosts New Zealand, riding a high over the last year and coming off a 134-run hammering of South Africa at the very venue for Saturday, the scenic Hagley Oval, facing Sri Lanka - finalists in the last two World Cups. Two teams with good World Cup records, and who know each other pretty well. Sri Lanka have been stationed in the country for about seven weeks, and would have a good sense of the conditions. New Zealand, skippered by Brendon McCullum, are being talked up as title contenders after their best-ever Test year and with ODI series wins over India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>On Friday, a day before the World Cup opener in Christchurch, McCullum was asked once again about the added pressure of captaining one of the favourites, who are in excellent form, in front of the home fans. This is a massive game not only for the home team but for the host city, which remains in parts devastated from the aftermath of the tragic 2011 earthquakes. Whoever you ask, the theme of Christchurch's sporting fans needing reason to cheer has been resonant. <br/><br/>"I've got a job to do and its all-encompassing in terms of captaincy, opening the batting and trying to execute the strategies on the field. Is there extra pressure? I guess it is there on everyone," he said. "Just because the nature of it being a World Cup, I'm excited about it and I have high ambitions as to what I want to achieve. Whether you achieve them or not is another thing, but I go in feeling reasonably confident and secure in the fact that I'm surrounded by guys who I trust and believe in."<br/><br/>Belief. It's a word that has in a sense epitomised New Zealand's surge as a team over in the year leading up to the World Cup. Against India, a team that has regularly bossed them in ODIs in recent years, they won 4-0 last January. Then a Test series win in the West Indies, a 2-0 ODI loss at home to South Africa, before a come-from-behind Test draw against Pakistan in the UAE. In the subsequent ODIs, New Zealand won 3-2. Sri Lanka landed in the country and were beaten in the Tests and ODIs, then Pakistan handed a 2-0 ODI series loss. How do you not believe that this is a team who believes in itself?<br/><br/>"When you go into a tournament as underdogs, dark horses or favourites, it is all irrelevant once the games start," reckoned McCullum. "It's great because it drums up energy and anticipation and expectation, but once the game actually starts it is back to the contest in its purest form - which is bat and ball and someone wins and someone loses. So that is the mentality we've got and we know what works for us. That is all we can focus, not on how some people have an expectation from us and how some people are writing us off. It is irrelevant from our point of view. We know what we need to do to succeed and if someone else is good enough to beat us, then so be it."<br/><br/>Sri Lanka are also riding on belief, their captain Angelo Mathews insisted while he spoke of what the team has learnt from their time in the country. "It is nice to have played a bit more cricket in New Zealand before the start of the World Cup, but from tomorrow onwards whoever plays the best cricket will go on to win," he said. "I think we have a slight advantage. We got used to the conditions, we have a fair idea of what the wickets are like, but we've got to be aggressive and play good cricket to win against New Zealand. They are on a roll, they've been winning plenty of games in the recent past, so we need to back our strengths and be positive."<br/><br/>Sri Lanka have not zeroed in on their playing XI for Saturday's match, but Mathews confirmed that Lasith Malinga would play. His addition gives the team its bowling spearhead, a sling-arm fast bowler with 271 ODI wickets and the experience of two World Cups, during which he left an impression on both occasions. The significance of Malinga's return - he has taken 29 wickets against New Zealand in 21 ODIs - was not lost on McCullum.<br/><br/>"He's a world-class bowler who makes a significant difference to their bowling line-up," he said. "Predominantly at the back end of the game. He's a phenomenal death bowler, a factor which we have to overcome if we're going to succeed in this game. If we can head into those final overs with a nice platform, and if we've ticked off some of our key ingredients along the way, then hopefully we can put him under a little bit of pressure. Certainly Sri Lanka is a stronger team for Lasith Malinga's involvement."<br/><br/>If the conditions at Hagley Park over the two warm-up matches here this week are any indication, the surface will encourage batting and bowling. On Monday, Sri Lanka got to 279 for 7 in 44.4 overs and asked tough questions of South Africa who stumbled to a D/L revised target of 188 with three balls and five wickets remaining. Sri Lanka's innings contained a cut-and-pull-fuelled century off 82 balls by Tillakaratne Dilshan. On Wednesday, New Zealand racked up 331 for 8 in 50 overs and then bowled out South Africa for 197 in 44.2, with Boult and Tim Southee's early strikes effectively ending the match as a contest before Duminy and Vernon Philander produced gritty fifties.<br/><br/>Having played two one-day matches here on tour - an ODI in January and Monday's warm-up against South Africa - Mathews knew the nature of the surface. "It depends on the weather, but the wicket looks really good. There will be a lot of runs," he said. "If it is a good wicket, we will try and bat first. We've got the bowlers to stop the opposition and if we have to bowl first, we've got the experience in our batting [to chase]. So it doesn't really matter for us. As long as we play good cricket, our brand of cricket, we will be able to win."<br/><br/>McCullum echoed Mathews' views. "[The pitch] looks good, looks like it's got a bit of bounce and should be an even cricket wicket," he said. "That's what you want in a World Cup, a pitch that has a bit for both parties. We're going to have an even surface on which the team that plays the best cricket will come out on top. It's a good wicket that's been prepared."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sri Lanka</b> (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Kyle Mills, Nathan McCullum, Tom Latham]]></line>
