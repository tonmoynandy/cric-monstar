Ireland hardly get exposure against top nations while England's next generation didn't get an opportunity to show their wares. The forecast was poor for the day and the rain simply didn't abate.

Bairstow is quick onto the ball and hits the stumps at the bowler's end, catching Stirling well short. <b>Stirling run out (Bairstow) 2(5)</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Bresnan to Stirling, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Run Out!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, on a good length and just outside off, driven towards mid-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, tad fuller and just outside off, pushed back towards the bowler]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, back of a length and on the middle stump line, nudged towards the on-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, <b>wide</b>, Wood sprays this one miles outside off, called as a wide]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, fraction short and just outside off, Porterfield goes hard on the pull and mistimes it towards mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, pitched up and shaping away from outside off, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, tad fuller and just outside off, blocked towards the off-side]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bresnan to Porterfield, 1 run, fuller length delivery and well outside off, Porterfield is lured into the drive, gets a thick outside edge and down towards third man for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bresnan to Porterfield, no run, on a length and just outside off, defended twoards cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bresnan to Porterfield, no run, Bresnan pushes this one across the left-hander, he doesn't need to play at those, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bresnan to Porterfield, no run, tad fuller and a hint of shape away from off, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bresnan to Porterfield, no run, full and on the stumps, Porterfield presses forward and punches it towards mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bresnan to Porterfield, no run, on a length and in that channel outside off, Porterfield covers the line, lifts his bat and lets it go]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Tim Bresnan, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Stirling, no run, loud shout for LBW, this was full and swung back late into Stirling, he was looking to flick and missed, might have been slipping down leg-side though]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Stirling, 2 runs, too straight from Wood, ends up drifting onto Stirling's pads, flicked away behind square on the on-side for a couple of runs]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Stirling, no run, Stirling pushes it towards the off-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Stirling, no run, nicely bowled by Wood, back of a length and just outside off, gets it to rear onto Stirling, he pushes forward and the ball rolls away towards cover, off the splice of the bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, 1 run, tad fuller and in that channel outside off, Porterfield leans forward and drives it towards mid-off, off the mark with a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, no run, tad fuller and shaping away from outside off, left alone]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Porterfield, <b>wide</b>, Wood's first ball in international cricket is a leg-side wide, he slipped this one well outside leg and got to swing down further]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Porterfield and Stirling are at the crease.

Only three players, Alex Hales, Steven Finn and James Taylor, played in England's last ODI, the league match against Afghanistan during the 2015 World Cup. Several big names have been rested, with the Test series against West Indies ending just a few days ago. On the other hand, regular captain, Eoin Morgan, has been permitted to miss this match, owing to his IPL duties, so does Ravi Bopara. There are as many as seven possible ODI debutants in this line-up and Taylor has the honour of leading them into the park today.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>09:45 Local Time, 08:45 GMT, 14:15 IST:</b> The English international summer has arrived. It's a period wherein England are scheduled to play a total of 7 Tests, 11 ODIs and a one-off T20I. They will host the world champions, Australia, in a 5-Test Ashes rubber as well as runners-up, New Zealand, in a 2-Test series. It's a huge summer coming up and if there's a teaser, it's in the form of an one-off ODI against Ireland at Malahide, Dublin.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview:</b><br/><br/>James Taylor leads a much-changed side into what he says is a "new era" for England cricket when they face Ireland in a one-day international at Malahide, near Dublin, on Friday. After their underwhelming performance at the World Cup, when they lost their four games against Test nations and failed to reach the knockout stage, the England selectors have rung the changes with no fewer than six players in line to make their ODI debut, five of whom have never represented England in any format.<br/><br/>With regular one-day captain and former Ireland international Eoin Morgan allowed to miss this one-off game to play in the Indian Premier League, Taylor gets the chance to captain his country for the first time.<br/><br/>"It will be a real honour to lead out a young England side and although I have got the job by default because there were a few guys in the West Indies on the Test tour, it is really a special moment," said Taylor. "But there are plenty of fresh faces and young, exciting talent. It's a new era for England cricket, a chance to park the World Cup and look forward to a fresh start."<br/><br/>Surrey's Cambridge graduate Zafar Ansari, Kent wicket-keeper batsman Sam Billings, Somerset all-rounder Lewis Gregory, Hampshire batsman James Vince and Northamptonshire all-rounder David Willey are all hoping for an England debut while Surrey's Jason Roy is, so far, a T20 specialist. Meanwhile Adil Rashid and Mark Wood can expect a game after travelling back early from the West Indies, where England could only manage a 1-1 draw against opponents labelled "mediocre" by incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves.<br/><br/>It is also the start of a new era for Ireland but, in contrast to England, their stock continues to rise after victories over Zimbabwe and West Indies at a World Cup where they were only denied a quarter-final place on net run-rate alone. John Bracewell, the former New Zealand off-spinner who coached his country for five years, including at the 2007 World Cup, started work on Tuesday as Ireland coach in succession to Phil Simmons, now in charge of his native West Indies, but will have an observer role only this week.<br/><br/>Ireland's 14-man squad, selected before Bracewell's appointment, has already been reduced by one with the withdrawal of Tim Murtagh with a hamstring injury, further disappointment for the Middlesex seamer who missed the World Cup with a foot problem.<br/><br/>Victory for Ireland would strengthen their case for more international matches, a point made repeatedly by skipper William Porterfield at the World Cup. "We can play a lot more often," said Porterfield. "The public in Ireland are crying out for that as well, to see more cricket against the top-ten teams, especially in Ireland."<br/><br/>Taylor, who played at Malahide in the last game between the teams in 2013, said England faced a "massive test" on Friday. "It was an exciting game two years ago (at Malahide), but we were four down early (Taylor one of the wickets) and then Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara blitzed the ball to all parts and scored two unbelievable hundreds to get us over the line. It was a feisty (10,000) crowd and we expect the same atmosphere again."<br/><br/>"Ireland showed the talent they have got at the World Cup against good teams and played really well so we know it will be a massive test, but I have guys behind me who are going to give them a good run for their money," Taylor said.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England</b> (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor(c), James Vince, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Zafar Ansari, Tim Bresnan, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Steven Finn, Lewis Gregory, Mark Wood, Sam Billings]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ireland</b> (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Andrew Balbirnie, Niall O'Brien, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Alex Cusack, Stuart Thompson, Andy McBrine, Craig Young]]></line>
