			<line><![CDATA[McCullum put it across brilliantly in his post-match comments. It was a tremendous series and it is a pity that we had only two Tests. Something for the ICC to take a note of and to act upon. Anyways, it was great joy bring you all the action from the two games. Hope you enjoyed them as well. Test cricket continues, Australia take on West Indies tomorrow in the first Test at Dominica. Join us for that game. Until then, take care and Adios!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>McCullum:</b> "It's an excellent day, excellent 5 days. To bounce back after Lord's is a good achievement. A really proud Test win and I think it was a very good Test series. Right throughout our slip catching has been excellent, we work hard on that. Sometimes it is not easy to bounce back after losing the first Test. We were behind in the game, they were dominating for periods, but we were just waiting for our chance. It is no an easy feat to beat England in their conditions. Credit to Alastair (Cook) and his men, it was a great series and played with the right spirit. 1-1 is a fair result I guess and it is a shame that we haven't got one or a couple more Tests. Kane has a knack of picking wickets, he played a crucial role for us. I thought BJ Watling was excellent. Once we found out he could field for us, we went ahead and picked him."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Cook:</b> "It was a disappointing day today. Credit to New Zealand. They were 20/2 but built a partnership from there. They played attacking cricket and took the game away from us. The conditions came in, those two bowled well and took a couple of wickets. Adam (Lyth) to score his first hundred at his home ground is an amazing achievement. Ben (Stokes) took the headlines at Lord's. (Mark) Wood has also had a good series. Credit to Brendon (McCullum) and his team, took the positives and put us under pressure. I read somewhere that if everyone is in form you get 800 runs, but that's not how cricket works. Those two are wonderful players (referring to Ballance and Bell). They will be disappointed, but everyone has 5 weeks to work on their game and come back at Cardiff. It's been a real challenge, pleasing for me to score runs. Those 4 wickets just before drinks really hurt us. Trent (Boult) asked me why I score between point and third man. You need to judge well outside off and I am happy I did just that. I wouldn't mind a week off. I am not in the squad (when asked if he will play for Essex in the county championship). A lot of tough cricket coming ahead for us with Australia here."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Boult:</b> "Very special. To go through everything at Lord's and to come here and win the Test, nice feeling. It was a great feeling to come here, the batters did a good job and set it up for us. It is a different ball to what we use at home. I have played a bit of cricket lately. He (Cook) is a world-class batsman and it is good to come out on top. I do prefer the left-handers. The joke was Tim (Southee) can line-up against the right-hander and me against left."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Trent Boult</b> is the <b>Man of the Series</b> from the New Zealand side nominated by the England coach Paul Farbrace for taking 13 wickets.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Alastair Cook</b> is the <b>Man of the Series</b> from the England side nominated by the New Zealand coach Mike Hesson. The England skipper amassed 309 runs in the series.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Watling:</b> "It was tough conditions. It's pleasing to get the job done. I thought Martin (Guptill) and Ross (Taylor) put the pressure back on them, it was an outstanding partnership. To get 450 in the time we did was outstanding. It was obviously a different situation to Lord's. I thought I was in a bit of trouble, but it was great to get a chance. He had an outstanding debut (talking about Luke Ronchi), 88 in the first innings, his catch off Kane (Williamson) was an important moment in the match. It was important to get the win."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>BJ Watling</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his <b>163-ball 120.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The English team, led by Alastair Cook defied all odds when they came out to bat for the second time. Riding on Cook's gritty hundred and Stokes' special ton, they managed to score 478 in their second innings. Not to forget, they were helped by some hefty contributions from Root and Moeen Ali as well. New Zealand were chasing 345 to win, but their innings got off to another poor start as Latham and Guptill got out with no runs on the board. Taylor too followed suit and the Kiwis were 12/3 at one point. Williamson and McCullum too failed to produce anything substantial and New Zealand were struggling at 61/5. Even though Anderson and Watling put on 107 runs for the 6th wicket, both of them went back to the pavilion in quick succession, leaving the lower order way too much to do. The lower order tried to put up a resistance, but it was always going to be too much for them. Eventually, New Zealand were bowled out for 220, giving England the win by 124 runs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England were the deserving winners in the first Test, especially because of the recovery they made after being 30/4 on the first day of the match. 90+ scores from Root and Stokes, plus fifties from Moeen Ali and Buttler saw them post 389 in their first innings. New Zealand came out and batted sensibly, putting on 148 for the opening partnership. Even though both Guptill and Latham fell in the space of 3 balls, Williamson and Taylor batted solidly and added 189 runs for the 3rd wicket. Williamson too went on to record yet another Test hundred. In the end, New Zealand lost their last 7 wickets for just 120 runs and were bowled out for 523, taking a lead of 134. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>First Test summary</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[England came out and batted well for the little time they got, before rain disrupted proceedings. England were 44/0 when the players were taken off and no play was possible after that on day 4. When play resumed on day 5, England were not up to the task. Lyth went early, edging an outswinger from Boult. Boult then got Ballance out, who looked uneasy throughout. Craig sent both Bell and Root in the space of 3 balls and from 47/0, England were suddenly 62/4. Stokes and Cook then got together for a 40-run union, before Stokes edged one to Ronchi off Williamson's bowling. Cook got to his 42nd Test fifty, but got out to the straighter one from Williamson. Ali too failed to put on a partnership with Buttler as he was bowled when he left a delivery coming into him. Broad and Buttler then put on 35 runs for the 8th wicket before Broad inside-edged a Williamson delivery back onto the stumps. Wood and Buttler then defied the Kiwi attack for just over 12 overs, before Craig smartly snaffled Wood at second slip off Southee. Buttler played a few shots towards the end but got out to Craig as he decided to pad one turning in towards the stumps. New Zealand won by 199 runs and levelled the series 1-1.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Even though Latham and Williamson got out quickly in the second innings, Guptill and Taylor put on 99 for the third wicket to help stabilize the innings. Taylor and Guptill though fell in quick succession and New Zealand were 141/4 at that stage. McCullum came out and played an un-McCullum like innings. He played with superb intent and both him and Watling constructed a 121-run stand, helping New Zealand go past 250. McCullum got out, but Watling kept going from the other end and reached his hundred soon after. Ronchi gave him good support for sometime, before he edged one to Buttler off Anderson. On day 4, Watling was the first wicket to fall but New Zealand had extended their lead beyond 360 till that point. Craig though was very solid and with Tim Southee, took the attack to England. They scored some very quick runs and in no time, New Zealand had crossed 430. Southee fell for a 24-ball 40 and McCullum declared soon after, when the team score was 454/8. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Englishmen started off brilliantly, putting together a 177-run opening partnership. Cook continued his good form but got out to Craig after missing out on a sweep when he was on 75. During that innings though, Cook went past Graham Gooch to become the leading run-scorer in Tests for England. Lyth went on to record his maiden hundred in just his second Test but got out soon after. After the start they got, England though failed to kick on. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and Southee's brilliant spell on day 3 morning saw them being reduced to 267/8. Broad though came out and played fearlessly. The last two English wickets yielded 83 runs, with England finally being bowled out for 350. This was the 8th time in Test history that both teams were tied at the end of their first innings.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand didn't get off to the best of starts in the first innings, with Guptill and Williamson departing without opening their account. With Guptill's wicket, Anderson also became the 12th bowler in Tests to reach the 400-wicket mark. Latham though was solid at the other end. Taylor gave him company for some time, before he fell to Broad for 20. McCullum came out and smashed the first ball he faced for a six. He stitched another 50+ partnership with Latham before he got out to Stokes. Watling too failed to provide a productive innings and New Zealand were 5 down for 144. Ronchi though in his debut innings, came out all guns blazing. Latham and Ronchi provided some sort of respectability to the Kiwi score, putting together a 120-run stand for the sixth wicket. Ronchi too fell in quick succession, missing out on the fastest hundred on Test debut by just 12 runs. Good contributions down the order from Craig, Henry and Boult saw New Zealand extend their first innings score to 350.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Match summary</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The players shake hands. Buttler and Anderson congratulate the New Zealand players. McCullum leads his victorious side out of the park, they are greeted by Cook and the England team management. It was a terrific Test match and New Zealand came out on top. They have now not lost a Test series since May 2013. This is the 7th series that they haven't lost during that period.]]></line><line><![CDATA[91.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig to Buttler, <b>out</b> Lbw!! <b>New Zealand level the series. </b> It was complete misjudgement from Buttler.

Matt Henry too came out all guns blazing, but Brendon McCullum decided to call them back when New Zealand reached 454. The English openers came out and batted sensibly, making sure that they don't throw their wickets away. By the time the rain arrived after lunch, England were 44/0 in 13 overs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Rain played spoilsport yesterday as play was stopped just 4 overs after the lunch break.

New Zealand's lower-order scored some quick runs and helped McCullum declare, setting England a target of 455. Cook and Lyth for the second time in the game got the hosts off to a decent start before rain made its appearance. New Zealand will be the disappointed side as they had 178 overs to get 10 wickets, but that now has been reduced to around 100+ overs. England, on the other hand, will be happy that they have to bat out just one day to draw the Test and win the series.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>17:00 Local Time, 16:00 GMT, 21:30 IST:</b> That's it.

Also Watling took the bottom hand off the bat as he played that to soften the impact but all to no avail. <b>Watling c J Root b J Anderson 120(163) [4s-15 6s-1]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[J Anderson to Watling, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[81.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Watling, 2 runs, well played with soft hands, this one rose from a good length, Watling stabbed it down, wide of gully and gets a couple]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Now three slips and a gully for Anderson]]></line><line><![CDATA[80.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Craig, no run, sliding down leg, Craig flicks and misses]]></line><line><![CDATA[80.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Watling, 1 run, pitched up outside off, driven wide of mid-off who slides and fields, keeps it to a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[80.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Watling, no run, full and outside off, Watling opens the face of the bat on the square drive, Stokes at point lost balance while fielding the ball and threw it back over his head but no damage done as they don't take the single]]></line><line><![CDATA[80.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Watling, no run, pitched up outside off, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[80.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Watling, <b>FOUR</b>, connects with the square drive this time, pitched up outside off, swinging away, Watling gets forward and opens the face to place the ball to deep backward point, raced away]]></line><line><![CDATA[80.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Watling, no run, swing straightaway for Mark Wood, full and outside off, Watling chases after it looking for a square drive and misses, the sound was bat hitting ground, that's why the appeal for caught behind is turned down and rightly so]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[The new ball is available and immediately England take it]]></line><line><![CDATA[79.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Craig, no run, another fine bouncer, Craig has to be quick to duck under that one as it zoomed near his head, Anderson has a few words to say]]></line><line><![CDATA[79.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Craig, no run, terrific short ball, into the chest, Craig was looking to sway away from the line, but the ball followed him and in the end he awkwardly fends it away, doesn't carry to anyone in on the off-side]]></line><line><![CDATA[79.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Watling, 1 run, too straight and worked off the pads to square leg, for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[79.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Craig, 1 run, that is a tough chance and put down by Broad at mid-off.

Just the two slips in place]]></line><line><![CDATA[Now it's up to Mark Craig and the pacers to support Watling and help New Zealand post a stiff target. England bowlers have struggled with their lines and lengths and couldn't maintain control over the proceedings. English batsmen will have a huge task when they come out to bat as they most likely, would chase a target above 350. The highest successful chase at Headingley so far is 404/4 by Australia against England in 1948. Let's see if England can take some positives out of that and believe that they can chase a mammoth target. By the end of day 3, there were signs of uneven bounce which could be a major concern for England. Stay tuned as we are minutes away from the start of day 4 proceedings.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Hello and a very warm welcome to our day 4 coverage of the second and final Test between England and New Zealand. It's the visitors who are in the driving seat at the moment. New Zealand did well to recover from 141/4 to post a healthy lead on the board. Skipper, Brendon McCullum and BJ Watling played vital knocks as the latter went on to register his fifth Test ton. Watling's innings could well prove to be the difference between the two sides.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Watling, who exhibited sheer class and skill, achieved his fifth Test ton and the Durban-born lad will remember this gritty knock for a very long time. Craig looked firm during his brief stay and New Zealand will be more than happy to take a 338-run lead. Tomorrow it will be testing times for the English batsmen. Will they stand up to the occasion or will they allow the visitors to square the series? All answers, most likely, to be revealed tomorrow. Thanks for your company throughout. We will try and bring you the best of day four's Test cricket tomorrow. So don't forget to catch up then. Sayonara!<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Brendon McCullum played a complete un-McCullum like innings as he left the balls more often than not. His strike rate during the knock was in the mid fifties which pretty much reveals us the bloody mindedness of the Black Caps skipper. He was willing to put his head down, dig in for the team's cause. Even though his knock was cut short at 55, his innings set the tone for Watling and Co. to follow his ways.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Guptill scored his second fifty in the series and played with good composure. Taylor and Guptill, however, got out in quick succession and it fell to Baz and Watling to construct yet another partnership. The duo didn't disappoint as they stitched a 121-run stand for the fifth wicket. Brendon McCullum played a typical skipper's knock as he batted with purpose and patience. Baz registered his 29th fifty and also went past 6000 Test runs during his knock. Brendon was finally given out lbw to a reverse swinging delivery from Mark Wood. Even though he reviewed it, the on-field decision stood and he departed but not before he bailed his team out of trouble. Ronchi, who came in after the captain, nicked one to Buttler in his early thirties off Anderson.]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand carried on the good work from day 2 as Southee-swing effected the collapse of England's late middle-order. He dismissed Bell, Buttler and Ali in the space of five overs and restricted the hosts to 267/8. New Zealand bowlers kept bowling short and tried a few variations to Broad. However, the Nottingham bloke played his strokes fearlessly and built handy partnerships with Wood and Anderson respectively. England were bowled out for the same score (350) New Zealand posted in their first innings. When New Zealand came out to bat for the second time, it was Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor who helped the Black Caps gather some momentum after losing Latham and Williamson early.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Nice to see a few Englishmen go up to Watling and pat him on the back. Stokes was one I could see saying "well played". Watling leads the players off the field, bat raised. More claps from the New Zealand camp as Ronchi and Ross Taylor applaud Watling the batsman for his hundred. They know the significance of the knock. New Zealand in the box seat at the end of the day.

Cook finally was given out on review as he was struck in front off Craig's bowling. Lyth helped New Zealand's cause and threw his wicket away in search of a needless run. Once New Zealand took the new ball, the swing of Southee and Boult have all asked big questions to the batsmen. England lost 3 wickets in the span of 6 overs and it is now up to Buttler and Bell to put up some meaningful runs on the board. This will surely be a big day for both teams and I reckon today's proceedings will also determine the outcome of this game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[By the end of day 1, New Zealand were 297/8 and England needed just two tailend wickets to put an end to New Zealand's first innings. After Ronchi and Latham bailed the Black Caps out of trouble it fell to two bowlers - Mark Craig and Trent Boult - to deliver the other big batting surprise on day 2. The duo stitched a 40-run stand which helped the visitors post a good first innings score. As England came onto bat, Cook and Lyth batted with sheer patience and application as the duo put up a record opening stand for England at Headingley. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[England ended the day at 253/5, still trailing by 97 runs. The forecast for tomorrow isn't all that flashy though. With the new ball just 8 overs old, New Zealand will not be upset if there's some cloud cover first-up tomorrow. On the other hand, England might just be looking forward to another sunny morning. Day 3 might just turn out to be the moving day of this Test. Do join us for all the action. For now, cheers and bye..]]></line><line><![CDATA[Still at 236/2 and with the second new ball due, England held all the aces. They had not counted for the famed cloud cover of Headingley and the second new ball though. Trent Boult and Tim Southee - frustrated with the lack of swing until then, suddenly had the conditions in their favour. Ballance's poor technique was cruelly exposed by Boult while Root received an unplayable delivery from Southee. The match was suddenly in the balance. Ian Bell and Ben Stokes survived some tense moments but the latter was dismissed by Boult in the penultimate over of the day - to hand New Zealand the initiative.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Before his dismissal though, off-spinner, Mark Craig, had struck for New Zealand. He trapped Cook in front, although New Zealand had to request for a DRS review, after umpire S Ravi initially gave it as not-out. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[When Alastair Cook and Adam Lyth were going strong, England threatened to run away with the game. The duo added 177 runs for the first wicket - the highest opening partnership for England on this ground. The visitors looked helpless as the duo all but took the match away from them. It needed a stroke of luck - and that came with the run-out of Lyth - but not before the Yorkshire opener had racked up a masterly 107 - his maiden Test hundred, in front of his home crowd.]]></line><line><![CDATA[87.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southee to Buttler, 1 run, full and shaping away slightly from around off, Buttler drives it through the covers, the fielder from wide mid-off quickly gets across and keeps them down to a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[Last ball of the day coming up.

After rain washed out the pre-lunch session, New Zealand were asked to bat by Cook and England bowlers responded well. At one stage, the Black Caps looked like they were going to get bowled out for a modest first innings total. However, a 120-run Latham-Ronchi stand helped them achieve a decent total. Both batsmen got out in the span of three overs and left a daunting task to the tailenders. Craig and Henry are at the crease and the duo will look to steer New Zealand past 350, which I reckon will be a good first innings total at Headingley.]]></line><line><![CDATA[A historic day awaits England and Alastair Cook as the English skipper is just 32 runs short of becoming the leading run-scorer for England in Test match cricket. England are pretty well on top at the moment as they reduced the visitors to 297/8 from 264/5. New Zealand have only themselves to blame as four of their top seven batsmen failed to convert their decent scores into a big one.]]></line><line><![CDATA[We thoroughly enjoyed bringing today's coverage to your living room.

Sayonara!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Here are a few highlights/stats to remember on day 1:<br/><br/>James Anderson becomes the first England player to claim 400 wickets in Test match cricket.<br/><br/>Luke Ronchi's 37-ball 50 is the fastest Test fifty at Headingley.<br/><br/>Cook is just 32 runs short of becoming the leading run scorer for England in Tests. He will surpass Graham Gooch if he manages to do so.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Tim Southee couldn't resist himself from playing his natural game as he fell prey to the England's short ball tactic. Craig and Henry are battling it out and the duo will look to help New Zealand post a good total. Had it not been for those two wickets (Latham and Ronchi) it could have easily been New Zealand's day. But that's how Test cricket pans out. It will give you moments of joy and it will also offer you moments of disbelief and shock.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It fell to Latham and 34-year old debutant Ronchi to amass a healthy partnership and thankfully the duo responded with ease. Tom Latham looked all solid until he got to his fifty but he looked scratchy post tea. He seemed like getting out to every ball he faced especially during the Ali-Broad spell. Mark Wood, Ballance and Cook dropped Latham in his seventies and guess what! All three drops happened just in the space of 6 balls. He also survived a few lbw calls as England lost both their reviews when  Ali was bowling. Latham's misery was ended by Stuart Broad as he nicked one to Root at first slip. England had a plan for Luke Ronchi as they kept bowling short at him. Ronchi, who didn't look intimidated for most part of the day finally picked Anderson to perfection as he pulled one of many short balls from Broad.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[After rain prevented the pre-lunch proceedings at Headingley, it was England who won the toss and elected to bowl. James Anderson, as is often the case, succeeded in providing the early breakthrough as he sent back Guptill and Williamson in the space of 3 balls. Taylor and Latham then steadied the ship for quite a while. A Broad inswinger looked too good for Ross Taylor as he got out lbw for the second consecutive time. Brendon McCullum played his natural game right from ball one and essayed a quick fire 28-ball 41 which included 6 fours and a six. Just when things were looking all bright for the Black Caps, Baz threw his wicket away off the first ball after Tea. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Fantastic day of Test match cricket. And only 65 overs have been played. England players walk off. Surprising to see Anderson not leading the team off the field. This was his day as he reached the landmark of 400 Test wickets - the first Englishman to do so]]></line><line><![CDATA[64.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Wood to Craig, no run, no. He can't.

Short and down leg, he pulls and picks out Anderson to perfection. Broad and England are delighted. Their tactic has worked. The two well-set batsman have been dismissed in the space of two overs.

The right call too]]></line><line><![CDATA[48.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad to Ronchi, <b>FOUR</b>, gloved down leg and Buttler can't get there. <b>Close call for Ronchi.</b> On a back of a length down leg, Ronchi gloves the nudge, Buttler went leaping to his left to catch that but the ball was always winning the race, looks like the ploy is to get Ronchi out on the short ball.

The sort of look that tells you that he is in trouble. Interesting to see S Ravi not giving that. 99 times out of 100, the umpire would've ruled in favor of the bowler.

No inside edge onto the pads. But replays show that it was umpire's call which was not out. Sometimes this Hawk-Eye thing doesn't make any sense at all. <b>That looked stone dead to me and to everyone</b>. But that's how DRS works. One should take it with a pinch of salt and move on.

Moeen was so confident that he reviewed it before Cook could make the decision. Eventually Cook too signals for the review. If Latham has missed this, he is dead. No inside edge onto the pads when HotSpot is shown. Now onto RTS. Hit on the back leg. No deflection on RTS as the ball passes the bat. Now ball-tracking. Unbelievable really as the impact is umpire's call. Ridiculous! I can't believe it. Not enough of the ball was in line with the stumps when it struck Latham in front. Cook has a long chat with Tucker. Anyway the game moves on as Latham survives]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad to Ronchi, no run, Ronchi is completely beaten for pace on that.

If Kane Williamson proved his class with a stellar 162 in the first innings, England skipper Alastair Cook's 162 in the second was crucial in the side not falling behind.<br/><br/>And then there was Ben Stokes' sublime all-round effort - a century and a 92, and three wickets in the second innings - turned the course of the match. Equally impressive was debutant Mark Wood, who proved a perfect fit as the third seam-bowling option. New Zealand took 20 wickets and scored almost 750 runs, yet still lost by more than 100 runs.<br/><br/><b>Team News</b><br/><br/><b>England</b><br/><br/>After long, England dished out a clinical performance. Expect them to field an unchanged side provided there aren't any injury concerns.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Adam Lyth, 2 Alastair Cook (capt), 3 Gary Ballance, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Joe Root, 6 Ben Stokes, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Moeen Ali, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 Mark Wood, 11 James Anderson<br/><br/><b>New Zealand</b><br/><br/>New Zealand have fitness concerns over allrounder Corey Anderson (back) and wicketkeeper BJ Watling (knee). The wicketkeeper-batsman is only rated as having a 50-50 chance for the second Test after sustaining a knee injury on the opening day at Lord's, preventing him from keeping wicket for the remainder of the match.<br/><br/>Anderson only bowled three overs in the second innings because of his back problem. Luke Ronchi, who is uncapped in Tests, could replace Watling behind the stumps<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Tom Latham, 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Brendon McCullum (capt), 6 Corey Anderson/ Hamish Rutherford, 7 BJ Watling/Luke Ronchi, 8 Mark Craig, 9 Tim Southee, 10 Matt Henry, 11 Trent Boult<br/><br/><b>Stats & Trivia:</b><br/><br/>Cook and James Anderson are within reach of notable milestones heading into the match. Cook, who scored 162 in the second innings at Lord's, needs another 31 runs to overtake Graham Gooch as England's all-time record run scorer in Tests. Anderson is one wicket short of becoming the first England player to reach 400 in Tests.<br/><br/><b>Quotes:</b><br/><br/>"He is at the start of his career and an exciting prospect. I have known him since I was around 13 years old and he has always been similar in how he approaches the game." - Joe Root lauding Ben Stokes tremendous effort in the Lord's Test.<br/><br/>"That (being defensive) doesn't work for us. For a long time we had that kind of mentality which doesn't serve us anywhere near (as well) as an aggressive mindset which we take into games. Once you remain true to that mindset that gives you the greatest opportunity." - Brendon McCullum after he was criticized by some pundits for being too aggressive in his approach to field placings at Lord's.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, BJ Watling(w), Mark Craig, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Hamish Rutherford, Neil Wagner, Luke Ronchi]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England</b> (From): Alastair Cook(c), Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Mark Wood, James Anderson, Chris Jordan]]></line>
