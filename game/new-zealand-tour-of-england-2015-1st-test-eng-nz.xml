			<line><![CDATA[England and New Zealand will now travel to Leeds for their second and last Test of the series at Headingley on Friday. Cricket has made its return in Pakistan after a gap of 6 years and to their fans' delight Pakistan have sealed the T20 series against Zimbabwe. Join us for all the Pakistan-Zimbabwe ODI action tomorrow. Thanks for your company. Good night folks!Adios!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stokes:</b> "Without a doubt (talking about this being the highlight of his career). The whole game was very special. I have been striking the ball pretty well in the nets, didn't expect to play like that, bit of fluke I guess. There was always an opportunity to score with attacking fields and Lord's has a fast outfield. It always makes the game easy when you can enjoy the game. We are calling him (Joe Root) the Don (Sir Don Bradman) at the moment, hope his form continues. The crowd were absolutely sensational. Thanks a lot for everyone to come out and support us."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ben Stokes</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his allround performance. The Durham lad scored 193 runs and picked up 3 wickets.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Cook:</b> "Never in doubt (talking about his feeling when he saw the ball fly down to Mooen Ali). Thank God he (Mooen Ali) hung onto it. Certainly up there (talking about his ton). They bowled really well. We got a bit lucky, we needed some luck. Ben (Stokes) came in and played an innings which I have never seen before. It was a fantastic knock from Ben. We started bowling well from day 3. We did not bowl well on day 2, but came back well. Wood looked brilliant. This week has been a rocky roll and to come out and perform like this is outstanding. We have been incredibly lucky to have such support. To have support on a 5th day of a Lord's Test, we are very lucky. I can't actually remember Lord's being more louder. Today we are just going to concentrate on what a fantastic Test match we have played. All the external stuff we will leave it for later. We were in a little bit of a limbo and if we play like that when we are in a limbo then I'm pretty happy."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>McCullum:</b> "The boys are hurting a bit. Credit to England for the way they played right throughout. They grabbed the initiative when it was needed. Credit to our boys as well. It was a great game and a great ad to Test cricket. We scored over 730 runs and still lost. We can go with our heads held high to Headingley. It was such a fine line with success and failure when two quality sides are playing. Ben and Root played with a lot of freedom and put them ahead in the game. Losing your top 3, rips the heart out of the batting. It was a tactical decision, he is a fighter (talking about promoting Watling). We were thinking if he (Watling) and Kane would have stitched a partnership, then me and Corey would have played our natural game. I was still delighted with the way our bowlers bowled. They are phenomenal bowlers and managed to take 20 wickets. We have to replot our strategy before we head into the next game."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Here are a few highlights of this game:<br/><br/>James Anderson is just one short of 400 wickets in Test match cricket.<br/><br/>Ben Stokes 85-ball 100 is the fastest Test century at the Home of Cricket.<br/><br/>1610 - The number of runs scored in this Test match, highest at Lord's.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It has been a great Test match where battle between ball and bat was well balanced. There were times when the pitch looked flat and batsmen scored freely and also there were times where the ball was wobbling around and the batsmen had absolutely no clue. That's what Test match cricket is all about. England were 30/4 in the first hour of the first day. None of the pundits could have written a script for what has to happen 4 days later. England exhibited patience and aggression with the bat and the ball respectively. That's when you win Test matches and for sure this will remain as one of the great wins in English cricket.]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand failed to replicate what Sri Lanka managed to do last year at the very same ground. The hosts had to contend with a draw the previous year as they failed to pick up the tenth wicket in the last five balls. But this time, they turned it around and ensured that they wrapped up the match with more than 9 overs left. Debutants Mark Wood and Matt Henry were pretty impressive and showed some promise with the ball.]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand got off to the worst of starts as both openers departed without troubling the scorers. Ross Taylor got off to a start but failed to convert it into a great one as he exposed his poor footwork to an inswinger off Broad. Williamson and Watling steadied the ship and played cautiously for a brief period. Stokes looked dangerous as soon as he was offered the ball in his first spell. It didn't take too long for the redhead lad to make his mark as he sent back Williamson and McCullum off consecutive balls. It looked like all over for the Kiwis before Anderson came out and smacked 14 runs off Stokes's very next over. Anderson and Watling got to their respective fifties and survived some scary spells. However, Watling's fighting knock came to an end as he gloved one to Buttler while trying to fend a short delivery from Mark Wood. Anderson was then trapped lbw and it took quite a while for the hosts to clean up the tail.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Black Caps, however, lost the plot as they threw away the last 6 wickets within 120 runs. Watling played a battling knock which helped his team post a 134-run lead. Boult and Southee troubled the Englishmen with the new ball as the hosts yet again failed to provide a good start. It was New Zealand's game till day 3 and from there on Cook and Root twitched some momentum as they helped England get past NZ's first innings total. Cook registered his 27th Test ton and went on to score 162 off 345 balls during his composed knock. Ben Stokes, the Durham lad, was the difference between both the teams. He missed out on a ton in the first innings but came out all guns blazing in the second. He thrashed Southee to all corners of the ground as the latter kept bowling short time and again. More than 75 percent of his runs came in boundaries which pretty much tells us the way he took on the hapless NZ pacers. The visitors never recovered after Stokes' onslaught as England went onto post a stiff target.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It has been a fascinating Test match throughout. England were inserted to bat and were rattled by the swing of the New Zealand pacers. They were reduced to 30/4 before Root and Stokes bailed them out by stitching a 161-run stand. Fifties from Buttler and Ali ensured that England posted a good first innings total. New Zealand came out with a positive intent as the opening duo, Latham-Guptill constructed a partnership which invariably set a good platform for the batsmen to follow. All the top four Kiwi batters scored in excess of 50 runs while Baz fell short of a fifty. Williamson extended his dream run with the bat as he essayed his first century at the Home of Cricket. The highlight of his innings was playing the ball late and leaving the deliveries more often than not.]]></line><line><![CDATA[All smiles in the England camp. As soon as the catch was taken the support staff and team management started celebrating. McCullum leads his side out to shake hands with the winners. It has been a riveting Test and it is England who come out on top.]]></line><line><![CDATA[67.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad to Boult, <b>out</b> Caught by Moeen Ali!! <b>England win!</b> Loud cheers surround Lord's. The players gather in a huddle and celebrate. Mooen Ali pulls off an excellent catch. Short delivery angled across off, Boult makes room and guides it over the slip cordon, the fielder was placed at third man, Mooen ran back and to his left, took it over his right shoulder, dives and still manages to hang onto the ball with his left hand. <b>Boult c Moeen Ali b Broad 10(26) [4s-2]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Broad to Boult, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[67.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad to Boult, 2 runs, short and on the stumps, Boult shuffles across and tucks it, the ball was in the air but wide of the short leg fielder]]></line><line><![CDATA[67.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad to Boult, no run, short and on middle, Boult backs away to the leg-side and knocks it towards cover]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[These two have survived 47 balls. Can they do so for another 60 balls and pull off the unthinkable? We shall find out as Broad comes round the wicket. Leg slip and short leg in place. Boult can expect the short stuff]]></line><line><![CDATA[66.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Matt Henry, no run, in the air and safe! England can't believe their luck. It went straight where Stokes was stationed. Short and at the batsman, Henry fends and the ball takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs towards point, Stokes was there until he was moved]]></line><line><![CDATA[Stokes has been moved into a 5th slip position]]></line><line><![CDATA[66.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Matt Henry, 2 runs, almost!

They didn't have a clue as to where to bowl to Stokes nor they found a way to dislodge Cook. The ball is now in England's court, what score they would feel safe to defend remains to be seen. Cook still batting in the middle will help their cause when setting a target. And we all know McCullum won't back down from a challenge. If the target is anywhere reachable, you can expect the Kiwi batsmen to go for it. An enthralling day awaits us. Hello and welcome to day 5 of the first Test. Stay tuned as live action is few minutes away....]]></line><line><![CDATA[The England skipper had not scored a hundred for almost 2 years and now he has 2 in 3 Tests. It is not one of his best tons, but slowly and steadily he is getting back his peak form which he was in 2 or 3 years ago. There was another centurion yesterday - Ben Stokes. He snatched the headlines away from Cook by scoring the fastest hundred at Lord's. The knock came off just 85 balls and it put England ahead going into the final day. The Durham all-rounder cut loose when the second new ball was taken and unleashed himself upon two of the best New Zealand bowlers. He departed soon after scoring his ton, once more falling to the off-spin of Mark Craig.]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand started day 4 on a bright note. Southee sent back Bell and Cook was still struggling to find his timing. Joe Root came in at No. 5 and took the pressure off his skipper. The Yorkshireman was once again in great touch as he raced along to his fifty. Another opportunity to score a hundred lay in front of him, but he missed out for the second time in this game as he fell for 84. By that time, Cook had got into his elements and was looking like his old self.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Root though gave it away pulling to long leg, missing out on a ton for the second time in the match. Will England push for a win? When will they declare? What is a safe score that Cook feels comfortable? Will we get a result? All the answers will be revealed tomorrow. Do join us then for a cracking final day. Until then it is goodbye and good night from all of us here. Do remember to sleep tight. Sayonara!]]></line><line><![CDATA[McCullum would've surely wanted more of Mark Craig as the ball was turning and bouncing if landed in the right areas but the offie disappointed. He was repeatedly short and taken for runs square of the wicket. His inability to exert any pressure put McCullum in a quandry. With runs leaking from both ends England quickly built up a lead. A few words about Root who came in on the fourth ball of the day. He was not fluent early on, played iffy strokes, was troubled by Boult, but once he got his eye in he played pleasing strokes and built a solid stand with Cook. That partnership gave England the belief which Stokes capitalised on later.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Even though Cook scored his 27th Test ton and his first at home in two years to banish a few of his own demons, the day belonged to Ben Stokes. Cook was on 98 when Stokes walked in. By the time their association ended, the partnership was worth 132 with Stokes taking credit for 101. Such was the left-hander's dominance that he registered the fastest Test ton ever at Lord's. It was a statement of sorts to people who had deemed him unfit to be in England's World Cup team earlier this year. Cook and Root had made New Zealand toil long and hard in the first half of the day. Tim Southee accounted for Ian Bell in the first over of the day but thereafter the duo batted with composure and exceptional technique to blunt the attack. The decimation of the New Zealand attack was complete when Stokes went berserk against Boult, Southee and the second new ball. The all-rounder had scored 30 off 44 balls at the start of the 83rd over. He needed only 41 more balls to get his name up on the Lord's Honours Board. He hit 65 runs off 37 balls from New Zealand's premier pacers in that period and left them famished. His knock was the difference between England settling for a draw to thinking about a win. Cook's resoluteness was important to allow Stokes' belligerence. The duo's contrasting tons has set up the final day quite nicely]]></line><line><![CDATA[That will be <b>stumps</b> on day 4. McCullum has a smile and pats Cook on the back. Guptill and all the Kiwis come up and shake the England captain's hand. That is how the game should be played. In the right spirit. That's why the Black Caps are such a loved side. They play the game hard but fair and at the end of it applaud the opposition's efforts. What a captain - McCullum is - certainly a credit to his team. Cook walks off to a standing ovation. He has remained undefeated having batted the whole day.]]></line><line><![CDATA[117.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southee to Moeen Ali, no run, that is such a bad shot, to the last ball of the day, wide outside off, Moeen Ali flashes and misses.

He played some delightful strokes before he nicked one to Southee off Boult. Ballance, yet again exposed his poor foot work as Southee pegged his off-stump with a brilliant outswinger. Bell looked positive and showed some promise during his knock. Cook nicked a few but fortunately it didn't carry as the England skipper played with soft hands. Tomorrow will be a big day as both teams will look to dominate the proceedings. England would be hoping to get past NZ's lead and will look to post a good total. New Zealand will hope for some early wickets and try to tighten the grip on this game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[It has been a satisfying day for both the teams. First England managed to break the partnership between Taylor and Williamson as New Zealand lost the last seven wickets for just 120 runs. Baz and Watling showed some intent with the bat as the former failed to convert a good score into a great one. Watling played a handy knock as he registered his first fifty in England. His innings also helped New Zealand achieve a 134-run lead. Mark Wood was the pick of the bowlers as he generated good pace and bounce from the pitch. Stokes was unlucky not to get a wicket as his team mates put down a few chances off his bowling.]]></line><line><![CDATA[25.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig to Cook, no run, floated up just outside off, Cook lunges forward and dead-bats it]]></line><line><![CDATA[Last ball of the day coming up]]></line><line><![CDATA[25.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig to Cook, no run, flighted delivery on off, Cook presses forward and blocks]]></line><line><![CDATA[25.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig to Cook, no run, this one turns away from well outside off, Cook puts his front foot forward and leaves it for the keeper]]></line><line><![CDATA[25.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig to Cook, 2 runs, flatter outside off, Cook rocks back and cuts it towards cover, where Henry misfields and allows the batsmen to take two]]></line><line><![CDATA[A leg gully is in place now.

Southee though faltered trying to pull Anderson out of the park.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England started off brightly after the rain delay. Corey Anderson hit a lovely boundary before he was strangled down the leg-side by Wood. Under a thick cloud cover, the ball was swinging quite a bit and Mark Wood and Stuart Broad bowled in good areas, making the Kiwi batsmen work hard for their runs. Williamson, who had batted with great composure to reach his ton earlier, played and missed quite a number of balls.]]></line><line><![CDATA[126.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Matt Henry, no run, full and slanting into the batsman, Henry drives and picks out mid-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[126.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Anderson to Matt Henry, <b>FOUR</b>, lovely shot!

At one point, it seemed that Ali and Buttler will take the score past 400. NZ openers, Guptll and Latham played cautiously and punished the poor deliveries. Latham looked a bit tentative while Guptill played some handsome strokes. Someone is laughing against Mark Wood I guess, the Durham lad gets a chance to represent his country and almost gets a wicket in his third over, but guess what! He overstepped and was denied a maiden wicket. However, this bloke showed some promise and intent. Cook will give him a good go for the rest of the day I believe. Let's see if England can get some quick wickets or will NZ convert the decent start into a great one?]]></line><line><![CDATA[New Zealand came out to bat under overcast conditions and have done well not to lose a wicket.

He reckons that there has been wear and tear on the pitch from day 1. Still a bit dry underneath and it may assist the spinners as the game goes on. But if you get in, it will be a good day for batting.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Just when Stokes looked set for a hundred, he misjudged an arm ball from Craig and got bowled, missing out on a deserving hundred. Root too missed out on a hundred - his third if he had got there at Lord's - bottom-edging a cut off Mark Henry. And then off the final ball of the day, Boult got Buttler out lbw to give New Zealand more cheer after a 103-run stand between Moeen Ali and Buttler had threatened to make it England's day]]></line><line><![CDATA[When England were 30/4, New Zealand were in the driving seat and well on top. Then the Root and Stokes show took over as they started England's fightback. While Root was cautious to begin with, Stokes played his natural game and put the pressure back on the opposition with attacking batting. Gradually the New Zealand attack wilted under the onslaught and England began to breathe easy]]></line><line><![CDATA[It has been a fairly satisfying day for the England and not many would have expected them to recover so well after being reduced to 30/4. Root and Stokes bailed them out of trouble as the duo stitched a 161-run stand for the fifth wicket. Matt Henry, the debutant was the pick of the bowlers as he claimed the key wickets in the form of Cook, Bell and Root. Stokes and Root both fell short of a century at the iconic ground. A lot depends on the first session of the second day as both teams will look to grab some momentum. We will bring you all the second day's action tomorrow and do catch up for the second eliminator of the Indian Premier League. Thanks for your company and good night folks.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Buttler reached his fourth fifty and played some delightful strokes during the knock. NZ took the new ball straightaway after the 80th over where Baz decided to operate with Southee and Boult. The duo got some swing early on but failed to force the batsmen to commit a false stroke. New Zealand will be surely disappointed as they failed to sustain the momentum they got early on. Just when the proceedings were to end, Buttler was adjudged lbw off Boult's bowling. Maybe he was thinking about his plans for the second day. He reviewed it straightaway and the onfield decision stood. He would be disappointed with himself after having such a good outing with the bat.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Root will be the most disappointed man by the end of the first day after he fell short of a well deserved ton. Since Root's dismissal, Buttler and Moeen Ali ensured that they pushed the score further as the duo managed to build a 103-run partnership. McCullum persisted with the spinner and also tried Corey Anderson in search of a wicket. However, Root and Buttler didn't offer them any chance. NZ pacers came hard at Moeen Ali as they tried the short ball a little too much. Ali wasn't intimidated by the ploy of the Black Caps. Although Ali offered a tough chance to Southee on 32, he punished the freebies and offered good support to Buttler.]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boult to Buttler, <b>out</b> Lbw!! A nice way to end the day for New Zealand. It was a top nut from Boult. Pitched on middle and swung back in, Buttler stayed rooted to the crease, missed the flick and was rapped on the back pad. That looked dead straightaway, umpire Ravi confirmed that. However, Buttler had a discussion with Ali and went for the review. The Hawk-Eye clearly showed it was hitting middle-stump. A fine innings comes to an end. <b>Buttler lbw b Boult 67(126) [4s-9]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Boult to Buttler, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Lbw!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Buttler has been given out LBW.

Tim Southee and Trent Boult are the best new ball pair going around in the world at the moment. They are backed up by the likes of Neil Wagner, Corey Anderson and James Neesham, while Mark Craig provides the spin option for McCullum. Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor and McCullum himself form the nucleus of the middle-order. Tom Latham has had a fruitful start to his Test career, scoring consecutive hundreds in UAE.

He has also brought about a new brand of cricket which has caught the attention of everyone following the game closely.

This side will go down as one of the best their country has produced, if they keep going in the same way.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's now turn our focus to the other team - New Zealand. The Kiwis have grown in stature ever since Brendon McCullum took over the captaincy reins from Ross Taylor. They have not lost a series since two years and the last time they lost one was here in England. A drawn series in Bangladesh, followed by wins over West Indies and India at home. That was followed by a series win in the Caribbean and a drawn series against Pakistan in the UAE. Thus making them one of the most consistent sides in recent times.]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Kevin Pietersen and ECB love affair has been much talked about in recent times. After being dropped from the side after the Ashes series, the board pretty made sure that, that was the last everyone would see KP in an England team. Even the newly appointed coach, Peter Moores stated that England are moving ahead and Pietersen was not in their plans. However, a door opened after a debacle at the World Cup and more voices were raised to bring back KP. The hard-hitting batsman went back to County cricket and scored his career best first-class score, 355*. The newly appointed director of England cricket Andrew Strauss, who had sacked Moores was forced to have a meeting with Pietersen. After the meeting, Strauss revealed that there is no trust between KP and the rest of the England team, hence he won't make a comeback in the near future.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There were some positives though - Alastair Cook scored a hundred after almost two years. Joe Root kept growing as a player by scoring heaps of runs. James Anderson single-handedly won them the second Test and is at the prime of his career, having won back-to-back Man of the Series awards. Ian Bell remained the mainstay in the middle-order, while Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes had a couple of decent outings.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Since then, England have lost to Sri Lanka at home, won against India and drew the series in the Caribbean. In the recently concluded series versus West Indies, England had the chance to win it, but they faltered in the final Test. Having drawn the first, won the second, they came into the third Test on a high, took the first innings lead, but couldn't take advantage of that as they were blown away in the second innings. West Indies' batsmen then made sure that they overhauled the target and draw the series.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England have not been the same side after the disastrous 2013-14 Ashes series Down Under. They were thrashed, beaten, humiliated, but above all that it has left a mental scare on some of the players that were involved. It also brought about the cracks within the team - Kevin Pietersen was given the axe, Jonathan Trott left after the Brisbane Test, Graeme Swann retired midway through the series and Andy Flower stepped down as coach.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview:</b><br/>As the football season in England dwindles to a finish, the attention of the British Isles will shift to the impending three-month summer of cricket that will culminate with the all-important Ashes series. But before England can shift their focus to Australia, Brendon McCullum and his resurgent New Zealand side pay a visit for a two-match Test series that begins with a Test at Lord's.<br/><br/>England, shrouded in the aftermath of another long-drawn out controversy involving Kevin Pietersen's snubbing, have to bounce back quickly following a below-par show in the Caribbean last month. The two Tests however offer them a chance to put the latest of management related fiascoes behind them as they look to prepare for sterner tests ahead.<br/><br/>New Zealand's Test side have enjoyed a renaissance of sorts in the last 15-months and are unbeaten in six series, a stark contrast to the team that was dismissed 2-0 the last time they were in England in 2013. After recording their best ever year of Test cricket in 2014, Brendon McCullum and Co. arrive on English shores on the back of a home series win over Sri Lanka followed by a run to the final of the World Cup. If ever there was a chance to pip England in England, it is now.<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Lord's Cricket Ground, London<br/><br/><b>Date:</b> May 21, 2015<br/><br/><b>Time:</b> 10:00 GMT, 15:30 IST<br/><br/><b>Weather:</b> Partly Cloudy, with a high of 21 degree Celsius and a 30% chance of rain<br/><br/><b>Team News:</b><br/><br/><b>England:</b><br/><br/>Having named only a 12-man squad for the Test match, England's selection of the playing eleven should be fairly straightforward. Following Jonathan Trott's retirement, Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth will open the batting with Alastair Cook. Durham seamer Mark Wood may however have to wait for his debut if England stick with Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes.<br/><br/>Probable XI: Alastair Cook (c), Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Ben Stokes, Jos Butler (wk), Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, James Anderson<br/><br/><b>New Zealand:</b><br/><br/>The Black Caps have several players jetting in straight from the IPL. Despite missing out on warm-up games, the new ball attack of Tim Southee and Trent Boult will find the muggy conditions in England to their advantage. Coach Mike Hesson mentioned earlier in the week that both pace-bowling all-rounder Corey Anderson and off-spinner Mark Craig will play. Matt Henry's performance in the tour warm-up may help him just pip Doug Bracewell and Neil Wagner. Martin Guptill's 150 against Worcester has added to Hesson's selection quandary for he'd have to sit out one of Tom Latham or Hamish Rutherford to make place for Guptill.<br/><br/>Probable XI: Tom Latham, Hamish Rutherford, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum (c), Corey Anderson, BJ Watling (wk), Mark Craig, Matt Henry, Tim Southee, Trent Boult<br/><br/><b>Stats and Trivia:</b><br/><br/>- New Zealand have won only four Tests in 52 attempts in England<br/>- This will be New Zealand's 100th Test against England since the first match in Christchurch in 1930.<br/><br/><b>Quotes:</b><br/><br/>"It's a completely different format, there has been a lot of cricket since. They are a dangerous side in their own conditions and leading into a big summer for them they'll want to start on the right note."<br/><br/>- Tim Southee on what he'll carry forward from his spell of 7/31 against England in the World Cup.<br/><br/>"We are going to have to be brave, take the odd gamble here and there, and if we play good cricket, we can start changing people's opinions on the team and start getting people talking about cricket again, which is what we all play for."<br/><br/>- Ian Bell on the upcoming summer of Test cricket amidst another Kevin Pietersen controversy.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>New Zealand</b> (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, BJ Watling(w), Mark Craig, Tim Southee, Neil Wagner, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Matt Henry, Luke Ronchi, Hamish Rutherford]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>England</b> (From): Alastair Cook(c), Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Mark Wood]]></line>
