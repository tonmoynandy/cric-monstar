			<line><![CDATA[The trophy has been presented to Misbah. The rest of the team join their skipper with beaming smiles. It has beeen a tough tour for Pakistan but they will go home with a smile. That ends yet another series. But there's plenty more to come. India are the next team to tour Bangladesh. It's a short tour, just one Test and 3 ODIs. The one-off Test starts at Fatullah on June 10th. Do join us for all the action. For now, cheers and bye..]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Azhar Ali:</b> 'It's a combined effort from the team. Everyone played their part in this Test series. Thanks to the training staff, they backed us very well. Getting centuries is very satisfying, but getting a double ton is special. We always try to match the class of Younis Khan. He is an inspiration for us. We have played really well in the past few series. We are proving ourselves to be a very good Test team. All the credit should go to the team management.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Azhar Ali</b> is the <b>MoM</b> as well as the <b>MoS</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Misbah:</b> 'It was a much needed win for us. The team showed good character. The first session of this Test was very important. Azhar and Younis set up a superb base for us and the bowlers took advantage of it. Our bowlers enjoyed bowling on this surface. There wasn't much help for them, but they did extremely well, particularly Yasir. I wish my team a good series against Zimbabwe. I hope they improve their performance in the ODIs and T20Is. It's good that cricket is coming back to our country. Congrats to Bangladesh for the way they played in this series. The draw in the first Test was a sort of victory for them. Everyone were disappointed with the way the first Test panned out, we needed this win.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Rahim:</b> 'Obviously disappointed. We did a great job in the first Test, couldn't capitalize in the second. The two reprieves off no-balls, one bowler short, that hurt us. They are the number three ranked side and the results proved it. We have played some consistent cricket, this was the only match we lost throughout the series. The India series is coming up, we need to do well against them. Tamim, Shakib and Mominul had a great series with the bat. The bowlers need to be more aggressive and take wickets in the middle. That will keep us in the match. We have to take 20 wickets, we need to plan better during the series against India.']]></line><line><![CDATA[Bangladesh had batted for the best part of two days to draw the first Test in Khulna. A similar effort here wasn't easy, but there was a shocking lack of temperament shown by the hosts' top-order. Batsmen after batsmen fell to poor shots. The bowling was disciplined enough but they were never made to earn the wickets. Only Mominul showed some fight, but eventually, he also threw his wicket away. This has been a tough tour for Pakistan. They were blanked in the ODIs, beaten in the one-off T20I, but they will go home with a trophy to show for their efforts.]]></line><line><![CDATA[A comprehensive victory for Pakistan and they win the series by a 1-0 margin. They dominated the Test right from the start. Bangladesh didn't help their cause one bit after having chosen to bowl first. Azhar Ali and Younis Khan were reprieved in the form of no-balls and they cashed in. Azhar made his maiden double ton while Younis compiled yet another hundred. Pakistan eventually declared at 557/8. Bangladesh were shocking with the bat in the first innings. None of their batsmen barring Shakib Al Hasan showed a gumption to fight. The star allrounder was eventaully stranded on 89 as the hosts were bowled out for 203, conceding a deficit of 354 runs. Misbah opted to bat again and helped himself to a 72-ball 82. Pakistan eventually declared at 195/6, setting an improbable target of 550 runs for the hosts.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Pakistan players take a couple of stumps as souveniers. Waqar Younis and the rest of the team management celebrate in the dressing room. The Bangladesh players come out into the middle as the two teams shake hands. Pakistan will stay at third in the ICC Test points table. Bangladesh stay ninth.]]></line><line><![CDATA[56.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junaid Khan to Hom, <b>out</b> Bowled!! That's it!

This was similar to that. After taking the previous ones away from Rahim, Yasir Shah bowls a googly, pitches it outside off stump and gets it to turn sharply. Rahim was playing for leg spin there, he went on the back foot to cut, missed it completely and it sneaked through to hit the off stump.

Things did not go according to plan yesterday for Bangladesh and they need to play good cricket today to stop Pakistan from posting a mammoth total. Azhar Ali and Misbah-ul-Haq would want to extend Pakistan's advantage in the morning session, before upping the ante. It is a big blow for Bangladesh that pacer Shahadat Hossain, who injured his knee in the very first over the match, has been ruled out of action for six months. Although Rahim has a lot of option to choose from, he has only three frontline bowlers left. Life is not going to be all that easy for the hosts, but they will have to find a way to do well today.]]></line><line><![CDATA[So at the moment, Pakistan are in firm control of proceedings.

Ali used the opportunity and went on to share a mammoth 250-run stand with Younis Khan, who upped the ante in the second session. Both batsmen completed hundreds and forced Bangladesh to use as many as nine bowlers.

Although Mohammad Shahid removed Mohammad Hafeez very early, Sami Aslam and Azhar Ali steadied the visitors with a 49-run stand before the former gifted his wicket minutes before the lunch break.]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, flighted delivery on the off stump, Misbah looks to defend off the front foot, but gets an inside edge onto pad]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, on the leg stump, Misbah defends off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, tossed up outside off stump, Misbah defends off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, on the stumps, Misbah defends off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, spinning away outside off stump, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[89.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, flighted delivery just outside off stump, Misbah defends]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[88.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Azhar Ali, no run, good length delivery outside off stump, Ali shoulders arms]]></line><line><![CDATA[88.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Azhar Ali, no run, covers the off stump and leaves the good length delivery alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[88.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Azhar Ali, <b>FOUR</b>, bit of outswing on this fuller length delivery but Ali covered it nicely by leaning forward, plays a lovely little cover-drive and it races away for four]]></line><line><![CDATA[88.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Azhar Ali, no run, full and outside off stump, Ali shoulders arms]]></line><line><![CDATA[88.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Azhar Ali, no run, on a fuller length and outside off stump, Ali defends off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[88.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Azhar Ali, no run, fullish and just outside off stump, Ali defends off the front foot]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[87.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, no run, on the leg stump, Misbah defends off the front foot]]></line><line><![CDATA[87.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Misbah, 2 runs, spinning away outside off stump, Misbah guides it to backward point]]></line><line><![CDATA[87.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Azhar Ali, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off stump, Ali drives it to deep extra-cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[87.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Azhar Ali, no run, on the leg stump, Ali steps out and drives it back to the bowler]]></line><line><![CDATA[87.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Azhar Ali, no run, spinning away outside off stump, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[87.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T Islam to Azhar Ali, no run, tossed up on the off stump, Ali defends off the front foot]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Taijul Islam [28.0-1-99-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[86.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, fullish and outside off stump, Misbah lets it go]]></line><line><![CDATA[86.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, good length delivery outside off stump, Misbah defends with an angled bat]]></line><line><![CDATA[86.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, good length delivery close to the off stump, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[86.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, shortish and outside off stump, left alone]]></line><line><![CDATA[86.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, Misbah looks to defend off the back foot and gets an inside edge onto pad]]></line><line><![CDATA[86.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, fullish and on the off stump, defended straight back to the bowler]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[85.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Azhar Ali, no run, on the leg stump, turned towards square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Azhar Ali, no run, full and on the stumps, Ali defends]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Misbah, 1 run, slower delivery l outside off stump, Misbah punches it to long-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Misbah, no run, driven gently to cover]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Misbah, <b>SIX</b>, steps out and launches the flighted delivery over long-on, what a way to get off the mark]]></line><line><![CDATA[85.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Azhar Ali, 1 run, driven down to mid-off]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[84.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad Shahid to Misbah, no run, big appeal for caught behind but not given.

Stay tuned...]]></line><line><![CDATA[We saw Bangladesh playing some exceptional cricket to come from behind and secure a draw in the first Test match in Khulna. Mohammad Hafeez and Tamim Iqbal batted very well to notch up double-hundreds, while Taijul Islam bagged six-wicket haul. What is in store for us here in Dhaka in the final Test match of the series? Hello and a warm welcome to the second Test match between hosts Bangladesh and Pakistan. The pitch was purely batsman-friendly in the first Test and after the completion of the game, skipper Mushfiqur Rahim said that he hopes to get a sportive wicket for the second Test.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b><br/><br/>Bangladesh hope to build on their new-found confidence by securing their first-ever Test victory over Pakistan when the second and final match starts in Dhaka on Wednesday.The Tigers are buoyed by a remarkable fightback in the drawn first Test in Khulna where they avoided defeat for the first time in nine matches against Pakistan despite trailing by 296 runs in the first innings.<br/><br/>The gallant display followed their dominant form against the struggling Pakistanis in the limited-overs contests where the hosts swept the one-day series 3-0 and easily won the lone Twenty20 international.<br/><br/>In Khulna, Bangladesh showed their batting prowess as Tamim Iqbal hit his nation's highest score of 206 and shared a 312-run opening stand with Imrul Kayes (150) in the second innings.Bangladesh's series wins so far since gaining Test status in 2000 have come against fellow wooden-spooners Zimbabwe and against an under-strength West Indies.<br/><br/>But former Test captain Habibul Bashar felt the time had arrived for Bangladesh to take a major step forward and win the series against Pakistan, who are placed third in the official rankings.<br/><br/>"We can surely go for the kill," Bashar said ahead of the Test at the Sher-e-Bangla stadium. "We have a positive mindset which can help us gain an edge over the opponents.<br/><br/>"Our comeback in Khulna raised the team's confidence to a new level. Not many teams can do what we did against a side like Pakistan who have such a versatile bowling attack.After such a performance, the boys will naturally look for a win in Dhaka," he said.<br/><br/>Bangladesh are worried about the fitness of captain and wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, having already lost strike seam bowler Rubel Hossain for the Test due to a side strain.Rahim hurt a finger on the right hand while attempting a catch in Khulna and left the field. He batted in the second innings but was dismissed without scoring.<br/><br/>Bashar, a selector, said that Rahim could be replaced behind the stumps by the uncapped Litton Das, who was a wicketkeeper at under-19 level.<br/><br/>"Rahim can play as a batsman alone, but if he is unable to keep, we may include Litton," he said.<br/><br/>Pakistan have brought in all-rounder Bilawal Bhatti to replace seamer Rahat Ali, who had been ruled out of the tour ahead of the first Test due to a hamstring injury.<br/><br/>It was uncertain if star off-spinner Saeed Ajmal will be recalled after being ignored for the third one-dayer and the Khulna Test.Ajmal, who returned to international cricket with a remodelled action in the preceding limited-overs series, failed to impress with just one wicket in three games on the tour.<br/><br/>Ajmal told the Cricinfo that he needed time to regain confidence and return to his best.<br/><br/>"I knew it will be tough moving forward," said Ajmal. "I'd said prior to coming here that I need time and I am disappointed that I am not able to fulfil the expectations of the nation.But I spoke to the captain and the coach and they have a plan for me. I need time to regain my confidence. It does not come overnight."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pakistan</b> (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Sami Aslam, Azhar Ali, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Asad Shafiq, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Junaid Khan, Haris Sohail, Saeed Ajmal, Imran Khan, Babar Azam, Bilawal Bhatti]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b> (From): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(c/w), Soumya Sarkar, Taijul Islam, Shuvagata Hom, Mohammad Shahid, Shahadat Hossain, Litton Das, Jubair Hossain, Abul Hasan]]></line>
