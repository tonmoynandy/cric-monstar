Goodbye.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at some of the interesting <b>tweets</b> pertaining to this game:]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@SeerviBharath:</b> 300+ totals in each WC edition <br/>1975 - 4, 1979 - 0, 1983 - 4, 1987 - 1, 1992 - 2, 1996 - 5, 1999 - 3, 2003 - 9, 2007 - 16, 2011 - 17, 2015 - 19 #CWC15]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@cricketaakash:</b> Good win for Bangladesh...pre quarterfinal with England lined up next.

Too often we give too much weightage to the player from the winning side.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Mortaza</b>: "Boys have done really well, especially batters, really happy. Tamim (Iqbal) was outstanding, (Mahmudullah) Riyad, Mushfiqur (Rahim), Shakib (Al Hasan) and (Sabbir) Rahman were brilliant. Still our bowlers haven't bowled well, but it's a good thing that the batters got runs before the big games. We will try our level best to play well in all three departments. We still have two chances, so hopefully we will try our best against England, if not against New Zealand."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Mommsen</b>: "Very tough to take, especially after the last result. I think we did a lot of things right today, but unfortunately we couldn't put the whole package together. We were happy, we always knew it was a good wicket, so we still needed to go out there and bowl well, put the ball in good areas and try and create some chances. Unfortunately, we couldn't create enough chances to take 10 wickets out there. I was trying my best to keep things fresh and keep the batters guessing, but credit to them, they actually batted really well and managed the innings really well. It's a huge moment for the team. Brilliant innings, I was fortunate enough to be out there for most of that acceleration period (talking about Coetzer's knock). And some of the strokes that he was playing were brilliant to see, because we know what he's capable of. So, a huge moment for him and a huge moment for the team. Hopefully, people back home will be proud. We had a bit of time off after that Afghanistan game. We came back refreshed. We had some really good training sessions. I think we were out for today, definitely and that showed in the first half, but unfortunately it was not to be. Throughout the four games so far we've showed that we are capable of playing good cricket. It's just a case of us playing good cricket for a longer time now. Two very tough games to come, but that's all the more exciting and something that we are very much looking forward to."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Coetzer</b>: "Not the way we wanted to end the game. We were just not able to create pressure to pick up a few wickets. I think we would have taken that score at the start of the day. Like I said, we just needed to create a bit of pressure, we didn't get many opportunities to pick up those wickets. There were a couple of run-out chances maybe, but other than that I thought they batted really well. It's been nice to score a few runs but at the end of the day, it's the end result of the game and that's just a bit disappointing today. Maybe, we would have liked to get to 330, but the batsmen at the other end were also scoring and that meant I didn't have to do anything rash. It's a tough one to take, the guys will be a bit distraught. We've worked so hard and I think we feel we deserved a win in this World Cup. We've played some good cricket, but still a couple games to go. So, fingers crossed."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Kyle Coetzer </b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Coetzer's stirring knock of 156 turned out to be the highest individual score by a player from Scotland in World Cups. He also became the first player from an Associate nation to notch up a 150. Incidentally, Scotland's total of 318 for 8 turned out to be their highest score in World Cups. Unfortunately for Scotland and Coetzer, it didn't prove to be enough on a flat deck. For Bangladesh, only Shakib bowled with good control, as rest of the bowlers struggled to stick to the old maxim of bowling line and length. Even in the slog overs, Bangladesh were below par. To make it worse for them, Anamul Haque suffered a dislocated shoulder while fielding. Bangladesh next will take on England in a key encounter in Adelaide. On the other hand, Scotland have the daunting task of taking on Sri Lanka in Hobart.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier, Kyle Coetzer's splendid spread of stroke-play took Scotland to a sizeable total. Coetzer, who nowadays, plays for Northamptonshire, is known for his ability to pick the length quickly and essay shots on the back foot in the County circuit. With Bangladesh's seamers bowling short, Coetzer took heavy toll of some ordinary bowling to compose a ton. Once he reached a superbly paced hundred by thumping Rubel Hossain for a six, he provided the impetus to the innings by smashing both Rubel and Mashrafe Mortaza to shreds. Matt Machan and Preston Mommsen also played useful hands.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[If Tamim and Mahmudullah set a solid platform, then Rahim upped the tempo with a quickfire knock. The diminutive wicket-keeper batsman, Rahim, produced a fine exhibition of stroke-play. In particular, in the 37th over of the innings, Rahim showed his class by stepping out to Iain Wardlaw, the former Yorkshire seamer, to loft him over the long-off region for a six. However, Rahim, then gifted his wicket away as he was dismissed by Alasdair Evans for 60. Shakib Al Hasan and Sabbir Rahman though, held their nerve to steer Bangladesh to victory. This was the first time that Bangladesh scored over 300 runs in the history of the mega event. This is also the second highest run chase in World Cups. For Scotland, Josh Davey was the only bowler, who looked like a threat. He found a bit of movement in the air and off the track to snare a couple of wickets. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Tamim Iqbal's crunching knock of 95 and fifties by Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan helped Bangladesh to overhaul the stiff target.  Tamim played a slew of magnificent cover-drives to put Bangladesh in the ascendancy. After Soumya Sarkar was caught down the leg-side, it was Tamim who opened up his shoulders to thread the minutest of gaps through the off-side with needlepoint precision and thwack a volley of eye-catching shots. Mahmudullah too played his part with a fine fifty. The 139-run stand for the second wicket between Tamim and Mahmudullah was the highest partnership for any wicket for Bangladesh in World Cups. Interestingly, Tamim's innings of 95 is now the highest individual score by a batsman from Bangladesh in World Cups.]]></line><line><![CDATA[48.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain Wardlaw to Shakib, <b>FOUR</b>, that's it! <b>Bangladesh win by 6 wickets</b> and put more pressure on England. This is their <b>highest successful run chase in ODIs</b> and it is also the <b>second highest run chase in World Cup history</b>. Full and wide outside off stump, Shakib takes a step forward, slices it over backward point and signs off in style. He gets to his <b>28th ODI fifty</b> as well. Rahman congratulates Shakib for reaching the milestone]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[47.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alasdair Evans to S Rahman, no run, it's clear, Rahman wants Shakib to get the fifty.

It was Machan, who helped Coetzer to construct a fine partnership of 78 after they lost a couple of wickets against the new ball. Mommsen came into the tournament on the back of being adjudged as the  ICC Associate and Affiliate Cricketer of the Year for his stellar performances in World Cup Qualifiers held in New Zealand in 2014, but hasn't exactly been in good form in the mega event. However, today, he proved his worth by playing power-packed shots and twinned it by cleverly rotating the strike.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Despite losing the wickets of Calum MacLeod and Hamish Gardiner upfront, Coetzer played with a dash of fearlessness. In particular, when Bangladesh's seamers bowled short, Coetzer took heavy toll of it by collecting boundaries. Ever since his debut for Durham in 2004, Coetzer is known for his ability to play horizontal-bat shots in England's domestic circuit. However, Bangladesh's seamers didn't look to bring Coetzer forward. Coetzer also showed his class against the wily spinner Shakib Al Hasan by slog sweeping him for a six. To make it a great day for Coetzer, he reached his hundred by lofting Rubel Hossain over the long-on region for a six. Once Coetzer reached his ton, he pressed the accelerator pedal and hammered Rubel for 18 runs in a single over and followed it up by thwacking Mashrafe Mortaza all over the park in the 42nd over of the innings. After composing a spellbinding knock, he was eventually, dismissed by Nasir Hossain. Coetzer now holds the record for the highest individual score by a Scottish player in World Cups. Incidentally, he is now the first player from Scotland to notch up a hundred in World Cups. He also became the first Associate batsman to amass a 150 in World Cups.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[On the back of Kyle Coetzer's sparkling knock of 156, and fine hands played by Matt Machan and Preston Mommsen, Scotland notched up a sizeable total on the board. Scotland's score of 318 for 8 turned out to be their highest total in the history of the World Cup. After Bangladesh won the toss and surprisingly, elected to bowl first on an easy paced wicket, it was Coetzer, who shone brightly by cracking a wide array of shots, especially on the back foot. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[49.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Davey, 2 runs, floated up on off, Davey drives it down to long-off, the batsmen come back for the second and the throw was not accurate as well, the batsman makes it comfortably at the end, <b>Scotland finish with 318/8</b>, their <b>highest World Cup total</b> and their <b>highest score against a Test playing nation</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[49.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Davey, <b>wide</b>, goes for the reverse sweep as Shakib bowls this well wide outside off, he can't connect and the umpire calls it a wide]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Alasdair Evans, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[49.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakib to Haq, <b>out</b> Caught by Soumya Sarkar!!

That is going to be an important phase today and make sure we get through the new ball. The focus will be on the middle overs and make sure we set-up the back end of the innings.

After being bowled for 142, they took 7 Kiwi wickets and gave them a run for their money. Against England, they managed to pull things back after Mooen Ali's hundred, but a target of 304 was beyond their reach. Their best chance came in the previous game against Afghanistan. The two Associates were involved in a thriller, which saw the Asian side chasing 210 down, after being 97/7 at one stage. It was a heartbreak for the Scottish players.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Carrying the intensity through the 100 overs has been a problem for the Associate teams. Scotland have managed to stay in the game for 35-40 overs, but have not been able to seize the key moments in the game. The bowling attack looks decent with Wardlaw, Davey and Evans bowling with a lot of discipline. Their batsmen Coetzer, Machan, Mommsen and Berrington have all contributed at some point, but are not consistent. Their next two games are against Sri Lanka and Australia, which means this is the best chance to register their maiden World Cup win.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Bangladesh started their campaign with a win over Afghanistan. Fifties from Shakib and Mushfiqur helped them post 267 on the board. Then, the bowlers rolled the opposition over for 162, with captain Mortaza leading from the front with 3 wickets. Their second game versus Australia was abandoned without a ball being bowled, thanks to cyclone Marcia. The last game that they played was against Sri Lanka. Dilshan and Sanga scored tons and put the game out of their reach. Chasing a target of 333, Bangladesh folded for 240.]]></line><line><![CDATA[There are plenty of concerns for the Bangladeshi side. The form of Tamim and Anamul is a worrying factor. Their dependency on Shakib and Mushfiqur to score the runs is clearly seen. They need the rest of the batters to show the application and they need to do it quickly if they want to qualify for the quarter-finals. Two wins out of the remaining three games will give them a realistic chance entering the final 8, but their next two games are against England and New Zealand. So, this is a crucial encounter for them.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>08:45 Local Time, 20:45 GMT, 02:15 IST:</b> Scotland come into this game still searching for their first World Cup win. They have so far played 11 matches and are yet to succeed. This will be their best chance to register their maiden World Cup victory. They face off Bangladesh, who are the only Test playing nation they have beaten - in a T20I in 2012. That should give them the confidence when they take on the Asian side. Let us have a look as to how these two teams have fared so far in the tournament.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b><br/><br/>For Bangladesh to have any chance to make it to the quarter-finals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, they will have to win two of their next three fixtures. After opening their campaign with an easy win against Afghanistan, they got a bonus point courtesy a washout against Australia; but a pasting at the hands of Sri Lanka would have had the ninth-ranked ODI team thinking. But, up against Scotland at the Saxton Oval, the Asian team will be hoping to stay alive in race for the knockout stage, before they face off against much tougher opponents in England and New Zealand.<br/><br/>Scotland, on the other hand, are still looking for their first in this World Cup and after failing to clinch a thriller against Afghanistan, the match against Bangladesh provides them with the last realistic chance to open their account in the tournament, before taking on Sri Lanka and Australia. However, the Associates can take heart from the fact that it was here at the Saxton Oval that another Associate nation, Ireland, defeated West Indies in the fifth game of the competition. Also, Scotland's only win against a full-member nation was against Bangladesh in a T20I in 2012.<br/><br/>Venue: Saxton Oval, Nelson<br/><br/>Start: 03:30 IST<br/><br/>Weather: It will be mostly sunny with the temperatures vacillating between 19 and 27 degrees Celsius.<br/><br/>Team News:<br/><br/>Bangladesh<br/><br/>Despite the wavering forms of Tamim Iqbal and Anamul Haque, Bangladesh are not likely to tinker with the batting line-up, but they could add an extra spinner in the form of Arafat Sunny or Taijul Islam to exploit the Associate nation's weakness against slower bowlers.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Anamul Haque, 3 Soumya Sarkar, 4 Mahmudullah, 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Sabbir Rahman, 8 Mominul Haque/Taijul Islam, 9 Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), 10 Taskin Ahmed, 11 Rubel Hossain<br/><br/>Scotland<br/><br/>Opener Calum MacLeod has had a horrific World Cup so far scoring just four runs from three innings, and it is likely that Scotland might bench him.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1 Kyle Coetzer, 2 Calum MacLeod/Freddie Coleman, 3 Hamish Gardiner, 4 Matt Machan, 5 Preston Mommsen (capt), 6 Richie Berrington, 7 Matthew Cross (wk), 8 Josh Davey, 9 Majid Haq, 10 Alasdair Evans, 11 Iain Wardlaw.<br/><br/>Player to watch out for:<br/><br/>Allrounder Sakib al Hasan has been in good form with the bat for Bangladesh and his his left-arm spin will surely prove a handful for the Scots. For Scotland, Matt Machan and Richie Berrington have been the stand out players, and to counter the Bangladesh spinners, these two will have to bat out of their skin.<br/><br/>Quotes:<br/><br/>"We are expecting a full spin attack from the Bangladeshis or we're preparing for that at least," Scotland skipper Preston Mommsen.<br/><br/>"Yeah, we expect to win. When we lost, we also lost some confidence. So this is an opportunity to win this match and go with some confidence into the game against England," Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza.<br/><br/>Stats and trivia:<br/><br/>The only win for Scotland against a full-member nation came against Bangladesh in a T20I in 2012<br/><br/>Tamin Iqbal needs 10 runs to reach 4000 in ODIs]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Scotland</b> (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain Wardlaw, Freddie Coleman, Michael Leask, Safyaan Sharif, Rob Taylor]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangladesh</b> (From): Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Taijul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Nasir Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Shafiul Islam]]></line>
