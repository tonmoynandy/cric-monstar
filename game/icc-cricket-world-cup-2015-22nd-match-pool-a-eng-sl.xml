			<line><![CDATA[Folks, that's all we have from this game. You can now switch tabs to follow the game between Pakistan and Zimbabwe. On behalf of <b>Bhanu, Sriram</b> and my co-commentator, <b>Akshay Maanay</b>, this is <b>Sidhant Maheshwari</b> signing off. Take care. See you!]]></line><line><![CDATA[After their defeat against New Zealand, Sri Lanka have made a fantastic comeback in this World Cup, winning three games in a row. They are now likely to finish either second or third in Pool A, depending on the result of their clash with Australia. On the other hand, England now have to win their game against Bangladesh to have any chance of qualifying for the quarters.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at some of the interesting <b>tweets</b> from this game:]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@cricketaakash:</b> 13000 ODI runs in matches as a wicketkeeper...imagine the time he's spent wearing pads and gloves.

Probably, 310 was a bit too much, but it was a brilliant partnership between Sangakkara and Thirimanne. We knew we had to dig deep and try and bat through the innings. We knew we could chase it down if we bat through the innings. It was two of the greatest knocks I have ever seen. That's what we want, if the bowlers fail, the batters need to step up their game and try and get us a win. The top 4 have been brilliant in the past three games and hopefully, we can continue in the future as well. I think our fielding wasn't up to the standard. We have to improve our fielding and bowling. There are not many teams who have chased 300 in the World Cup, but I think it was a great performance coming through the previous game and to pull off a similar performance in this game against the better attack was great. All that matters are the quarter-finals and the journey afterwards. We are getting there slowly and hopefully, we can peak when we reach the quarters.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Morgan:</b> 'We certainly lost it with the ball. At half-time we went in thinking that we had an above par score. All credit to Joe Root, magnificent in the way he played. I think he is the youngest English cricketer to score a World Cup hundred which is just great. It shows what sort of form he is in. I was happy at half-time. I thought Sri Lanka probably had 7-8 overs spell, where they bowled particularly well and tied us down. But again at that stage of the game, we got through and built it up for the back end. I think if you look back at the New Zealand game, it was an area where we lost wickets and continued to do so, again it was an improvement today. We are very flexible in our batting order. We are always talking how we can be ahead of the game. Again I thought it was the right move to send James (James Taylor) in. Today, we probably bowled a bad ball every one, one and a half overs. At this level, you get punished for it and we were punished today by a very experienced side. I think we have got variations in two tall bowlers and they get bounce when they bowl well. We have two swing bowlers, who are accurate when they bowl well. But today, we were way off the mark. It doesn't concern me at all (regarding one dimensional bowling attack with no bowlers who can change their pace). When we are bowling well it's a good attack. But, you can pick it apart if we are not bowling well. And today, we didn't bowl well. Both games that are left are pretty crucial but we have to dust ourselves off. There are positives that we can take from today. Our bowlers are pretty experienced, we don't have to look far where we went wrong. Hopefully, we can rectify that before the Bangladesh game.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sangakkara</b>: 'Well, the wicket was pretty good. Everything I tried came off. I think the real credit should go to the openers here. They had a great stand and I think that kind of start and that kind of solidity at the top really helped us. I think Thiri (Lahiru Thirimanne) batted out of his skin, that was an exceptional innings from Thirimanne. We were getting 5.5-6 runs per over right throughout. It was just the case of making sure we batted long and build a good enough partnership. Even if we had to chase 10 an over in the last 9-10 overs, we were pretty confident that we could do it. It is always an imposing target when someone goes over 300. I thought Joe Root again batted brilliantly, they got a good start as well. We weren't probably the best with the ball as well and in the field. When there are days like these, your batting side has to step up. Getting old quite quickly (smiles), but I am still enjoying it (when asked about giving up on cricket after the World Cup). But, it was great to watch Thirimanne bat, I think he has done the hard job for us. He has batted everywhere from 1 to 9, watch him get that 100 was exceptional.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sangakkara</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his unbeaten <b>86-ball 117</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, England set a target of over 300. Bell provided a bright start and Root capitalised on the platform that was set. He went on to score his 4th ODI hundred and became the youngest English cricketer to score a century in a World Cup game. Buttler provided the impetus to take the score past the 300-mark. Mathews and Dilshan were the most disciplined of the Sri Lankan bowlers. With this loss, England have made it difficult for themselves to qualify for the quarter-finals, while Sri Lanka are slowly gathering momentum as this was their third win of the competition.]]></line><line><![CDATA[England bowlers lacked the penetration. Anderson has looked out of sorts since the start of the World Cup. Broad is nowhere close to his best. Finn has been very inconsistent. Woakes was the only bowler who had some decent form coming into the game, but he too was put to the sword. Moeen Ali was the only wicket-taker today, but he was unable to contain the batsmen in the middle overs. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[He scored his first fifty in 45 balls and the next in 25, recording his fastest ODI hundred. On the other hand, Thirimanne kept going and played some delightful cover drives. Like Root, he too made the most of the dropped chance. Together the pair added an unbeaten 212 runs for the second wicket. At no point in time, they looked under pressure and always had the run-rate in check.]]></line><line><![CDATA[A comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka. The run-chase was paced to perfection. Dilshan and Thirimanne started off steadily and got going once they were set. The latter got two reprieves, first on 3 and then on 98, but apart from that it was a brilliant innings. Dilshan got out just when the opening stand reached the 100-run mark. However, that brought the in-form Sanga to the crease. The experienced batsman was simply outstanding in his innings. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Sanga and Thirimanne finish unbeaten and are all smiles. Thirimanne punches the air in delight and Sanga hugs him as well. Both of them shake hands with the English players as they walk off the field.]]></line><line><![CDATA[47.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woakes to Thirimanne, <b>SIX</b>, <b>Thirimanne finishes off in style.
