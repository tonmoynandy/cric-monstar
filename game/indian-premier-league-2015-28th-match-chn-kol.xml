			<line><![CDATA[Alrighty folks. That's it from this game. But the action continues tomorrow. It is Bangalore taking on Rajasthan at the Chinnaswamy. We can expect an exciting game as BLR are on a two match winning streak and RAJ are second on the points table. Will catch you all for that game. Until then, take care and Cya!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at some of the best tweets from this game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Harsha Bhogle:</b> Just too many people to call on for MSD. Today spin from Ashwin, Jadeja, Raina. Bravo at the end. #CHN. #KOL slept a bit in the middle overs]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Shahrukh Khan:</b> CHN played like the champs they are. Extremely deserving victors. We need to believe/play harder. Insha Allah. Nikal gayi  Chennai Expressâ€¦]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ayaz Memon:</b>  Sterling effort by Ryan ten Doeschate, but more important is how Chennai defended a small total. Whistlepodu!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sanjay Manjrekar:</b>  KOL lost but happy for Ryan Tendoeschate.This should do his confidence a world of good. He has so much to offer to the #ipl2015.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Anurag Rekhi:</b>  #CHN gave the game to #KOL on platter but I guess &#KOL was fasting today #CHNvKOL #PepsiIPL]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bravo:</b> "I think it is a great team effort. I failed with the bat with 7 overs left and wanted to do something special. Well done to Mahi (Dhoni), he led the team very well and won us the game. That catch was really special one, it reminded me 4-5 years ago when I started playing international cricket. I still have it in me. I prepare myself to defend 14 off the last over and if anything is over 14, it is a bonus. This is the kind of situations I practise, bowling to McCullum and Pollard back home. We always play as a team."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Dwayne Bravo</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his bowling figures of <b>3-0-22-3</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Dhoni:</b> "It's a fantastic victory. We didn't know what a good score is on this wicket. If you bat well, you could have got 160. Robin (Uthappa) got them off to a good start, but the bowlers did well to pull things back. Raina has done well for us and he bowls with a flatter trajectory. He rose to the occasion and bowled very well. I thought the bowlers did really well. We did drop two catches today, but we did field well. Russell's run-out was important for us. Brendon McCullum is lightning in the field, but we also have Raina, Faf and Jadeja. We just want to take one game at a time, keep doing well and moving. We need to keep winning and reach the quarter-finals and then take it from there."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Gambhir:</b> "Containing CHN to 134 was a commendable job. We should have chased it down, but the batsmen got stuck in the middle overs. With the start we got, we should have finished the game. It is a difficult pill to swallow. We can't afford to have those many runs at that stage of the innings, but Tendo tried hard. The bowlers have done a fantastic job to contain the opposition. One of the top 3 has to be there till the 15th over. We need batsmen getting 50s and 60s. We played too many dot balls and that is where we lost the match. We play them again in a couple of days and hope to turn it around."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier in the day, KOL's bowlers led by Hogg restricted the strong CHN batting line-up to a mere 134. The Australian bowled at the start and at the end, he kept it tight. For CHN, McCullum, Smith, Raina all got starts, but a handy innings from Faf saw them reach the total they got. These two sides meet again in a couple of days time and it will be KOL's home then.]]></line><line><![CDATA[As everyone expected CHN and Dhoni on that type of wicket is a formidable combination. Gambhir went off the second ball of the innings, but Uthappa came into his own and was looking good before he tried to take on Ashwin straightaway. After that, it was the spinners that spun a web around Suryakumar and Pathan. Raina rolled his arm and kept things quiet. When they need to up the ante, Bravo came on and varied it nicely. He also bowled the last over, where he had to defend 17 runs and he did the job for his side.]]></line><line><![CDATA[CHN players congratulate each other before heading towards the dugout. The KOL players come out and shake hands. It has been a superb match for CHN. With the win, they move on top of the points table, overtaking Rajasthan, while KOL remain in third position.]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, <b>FOUR</b>, KOL fall short by 2 runs. <b>CHN register their 9th successive win at home.</b> Tendo fought hard, but he had just too much to do. Another full delivery outside off, ten Doeschate shimmies down the and drills it to the deep extra cover fence]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, <b>FOUR</b>, ten Doeschate is doing it fabulously for KOL. It was a full delivery outside off, Tendo charges down, gives himself some room and drives it square of the wicket, there was no one in the deep and he keeps KOL in the game]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, <b>SIX</b>, massive! Is there still life in the game? KOL need two more of those to win it. ten Doeschate was expecting the slower ball, waits and waits before tonking it over cow corner, the ball sails over the rope]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, no run, Bravo has been simply brilliant, another off-cutter just outside off, ten Doeschate advances down the wicket and fails to make contact with the big shot]]></line><line><![CDATA[Dhoni has removed his pads. That will make him move quicker.]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, no run, second dot ball for Bravo, this is excellent bowling, again the change of pace deceives the batsman, ten Doeschate is way too early into the shot, misses it by a mile]]></line><line><![CDATA[19.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, no run, slower delivery which is short in length, ten Doeschate cracks the cut to sweeper cover, he doesn't take the single. He knows that he is the one who has to do it for KOL]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>17 runs required off the last over</b>. Can Tendo do it for KOL? Bravo to bowl the last over.]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to B Hogg, 2 runs, fullish and just outside off, Hogg moves away and drives it past the diving extra cover fielder, Jaddu mops up in the deep and the batsmen take two in the meantime]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Brad Hogg, left handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to U Yadav, <b>out</b> Bowled!! Knocked over! Umesh thought he wanted to go for the jugular. A length delivery in the slot, Umesh goes towards the leg-side and has a slog at that, he missed it completely and the ball hits the top of middle-stump. That was a mindless shot from Umesh, who had Tendo at the other end, he just had to rotate the strike. <b>U Yadav b Nehra 0(1)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Nehra to U Yadav, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Bowled!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, 1 run, Nehra comes round the wicket, bowls the low full toss, ten Doeschate toe-ends the drive down the wicket, Nehra bends down and parries it to long-on, Tendo wanted two but Umesh was not interested, the throw comes to Dhoni and goes over the head, the duo think about the second then, but the back up was quite good. Dhoni was not too pleased with the throw]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, <b>SIX</b>, smashed! Tendo is not giving up yet. A length delivery right in the slot, ten Doeschate gets his front leg out of the way and hammers it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, <b>FOUR</b>, a nice juicy full toss and ten Doeschate cashes in. It was at a good height as well, ten Doeschate heaves it towards deep square leg, it almost went the distance. The TV umpire checked and confirmed that the ball bounced before the rope]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, no run, top ball from Nehra, ten Doeschate was moving away to the leg-side, Nehra follows him with a yorker, Tendo can't get away from it, the ball hits his back leg and rolls away. The batsmen can't take the run as ten Doeschate was not playing a shot]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[17.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, 1 run, the 6th slower delivery of the over, ten Doeschate goes for the hoick towards cow corner, the inside-edge rolls to backward square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Umesh Yadav, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[17.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to Chawla, <b>out</b> Caught by Dhoni!! Second of the over. CHN inch closer towards victory. Chawla goes without troubling the scorers. Once more it is the slower one that outfoxes the batsman, Chawla advances and goes for the loft, skies it straight up, Dhoni calls for it and takes it right next to the stumps. Bravo embraces him in a bear hug. Chawla's bottom hand comes off the bat as he played that. <b>Chawla c Dhoni b Dwayne Bravo 0(2)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Dwayne Bravo to Chawla, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[17.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to Chawla, no run, another off-cutter just outside off, Chawla was totally deceived for pace, is early into the shot and fails to make contact]]></line><line><![CDATA[17.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, leg byes, 1 run, 108.5kph slower delivery, ten Doeschate fails to connect with the nudge to the on-side, Chawla calls for the run, Bravo moves forward, picks the ball and fires it straight into ten Doeschate, who was running in a straight line]]></line><line><![CDATA[17.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, 2 runs, off-cutter around off, ten Doeschate nurdles it to square leg, Bravo goes chasing after the ball but can't prevent the batsmen taking two. The commitment of these CHN players is unbelievable]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Piyush Chawla, left handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[17.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to P Cummins, <b>out</b> Caught by Ravindra Jadeja!! Another one bites the dust. CHN running away with the game. Bravo has his second of the game. It was the off-speed delivery, Cummins clears his front leg and goes for the mighty heave, picks out Jadeja perfectly at deep mid-wicket. <b>P Cummins c Ravindra Jadeja b Dwayne Bravo 0(2)</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Dwayne Bravo to P Cummins, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[16.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to P Cummins, leg byes, 1 run, loud shout for lbw, but the umpire just moves away. Nehra was pleading with the umpire, good length ball on the stumps, Cummins misses the flick, is struck just above the kneeroll, the ball rolls to third man. The only thing that would have saved him is the height]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pat Cummins, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[16.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, <b>out</b> A Russell Run Out!! 1 run completed. KOL are falling apart here. CHN have applied the choke superbly. It was banged in halfway down the wicket, ten Doeschate mistimes the pull to deep square leg, Jaddu runs to his left, picks it one-handed and throws it to Dhoni, who does the rest. It was Tendo's call as he was the one who called for two. Russell is not a happy man, he hits the bat on the ground as he walks off. <b>A Russell run out (Ravindra Jadeja/Dhoni) 4(4)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Nehra to ten Doeschate, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Run Out!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Third umpire called in for a run-out check. Russell thinks he is out. So do the CHN players as they are all hugging Jadeja. He is OUT!]]></line><line><![CDATA[16.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to A Russell, 1 run, shortish and just outside off, Russell slaps it to extra cover, Faf shies at the stumps, but Russell had made it]]></line><line><![CDATA[16.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, 1 run, pitched up just outside off, ten Doeschate walks across and lofts it to long-off, the bat turned in his hands and hence didn't get the timing right]]></line><line><![CDATA[16.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to A Russell, 1 run, full and on the sticks, Russell eases it to long-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[Ashwin still in the dugout, doesn't seem like he is going to come on.]]></line><line><![CDATA[16.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehra to ten Doeschate, 1 run, straight on middle, ten Doeschate shuffles across and works it wide of mid-wicket]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Ashish Nehra [2.0-0-20-0] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The equation reads <b>40 off 4 overs</b>.]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, 1 run, short and just outside off, ten Doeschate makes room and cuts square of the wicket, for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to A Russell, 1 run, rolls his fingers across the ball, Russell presses forward and dabs it to backward point, Tendo calls for a quick single and gets it easily]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, 1 run, ten Doeschate backs away and Bravo follows him, nurdled away to deep backward square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to A Russell, 1 run, full delivery angling in on middle and leg, Russell drives it to long-on]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Andre Russell, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Time-out</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to Y Pathan, <b>out</b> Bowled!! The strangle is on. Pathan looks at the stumps in disbelief. Bravo is overjoyed as he does another one of his jigs. An off-cutter which is short in length, keeps a tad low as well, Pathan goes for the pull and under-edges it onto the stumps. CHN all over KOL at the moment. <b>Y Pathan b Dwayne Bravo 13(18)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Dwayne Bravo to Y Pathan, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Bowled!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwayne Bravo to ten Doeschate, 1 run, starts with a slower one, ten Doeschate tickles it fine, MS moves across to his left and stops the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Dwayne Bravo, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Ashwin is seen coming out of the dressing room.

Shortish and outside off, ten Doeschate cuts it towards backward point and takes off, Pathan rightly sends him back as Baz hits the sticks at the striker's end, ten Doeschate was diving in to make his ground. He put in the full length dive]]></line><line><![CDATA[Third umpire called to check a run-out chance. Tendo is the man in question.

Floated up on the stumps, ten Doeschate comes down the track and whips it to short mid-wicket, Baz dives to his left and is not able to hang on.

That's a stunner. Bravo enjoyed it and so did the crowd. The West Indian runs off in celebration. A wicket at the right time for CHN. Short delivery from Mohit, Yadav was hurried on the pull, he spoons it towards mid-on, Bravo runs all the way from long-on, dives forward and snaffles it with both hands. He made sure he had control on the ball when he hit the ground. The best part was even Faf was coming from mid-off, but he was not put off by that. Replays show that, he went with both hands but the ball got stuck in his left hand. <b>Suryakumar Yadav c Dwayne Bravo b Mohit Sharma 16(26) [4s-1]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Mohit Sharma to Suryakumar Yadav, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohit Sharma to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, back of a length around off, Yadav goes for the pull and misses, the ball sneaks under his bat]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Mohit Sharma [1.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[11.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raina to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, too full and on the stumps, Yadav eases it to long-on and retains strike]]></line><line><![CDATA[11.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raina to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, tossed up around off, Yadav works it towards mid-wicket, Baz keeps the batsmen at their respective ends]]></line><line><![CDATA[11.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raina to Y Pathan, 1 run, Pathan goes back and steers it to short third man, Yadav sees that Nehra is the fielder and calls his partner through for a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[11.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raina to Y Pathan, no run, turns it gently to short mid-wicket, no chance for the single]]></line><line><![CDATA[11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raina to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, flighted outside off, driven away to long-off]]></line><line><![CDATA[Ashwin is going off the field.

Knowing MS, he might just be tempted to play the same combination once again.]]></line><line><![CDATA[On form, both teams have looked very solid. Hosts CHN are on a roll and the loss to Rajasthan has been the only blip to an otherwise flawless season. With five wins out of six matches, they are nicely placed with 10 points, just one point below Rajasthan, who have played two extra matches. Much of their strengths lie with their top-order. Dwayne Smith and Brendon McCullum have provided electrifying starts and that has allowed the middle order to consolidate during the middle overs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>18:40 Local Time, 13:10 GMT, 18:40 IST:</b> Many neutral experts believe that the two teams playing today will eventually meet once again in the final of this season's Indian Premier League. The other six franchises may differ with their views, but for now Chennai and Kolkata are up against each other in what should be a mouthwatering contest. This is the first match of the double-header between these two teams. Chennai travel to Kolkata for the return match in a couple of days time.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview</b><br/><br/>It has been a mixed season so far for defending champions Kolkata whereas Chennai have lived up to their reputation of pre-tournament favourites. CHN have won five out of their six games in IPL 2015, while KOL have won three. MS Dhoni's men are placed second while Gambhir and Co. are right behind at third spot. There's not a lot to choose from between the two teams but CHN's consistent record at home will give them a slight edge. For KOL, it is a chance to regain some momentum. Their previous two outings have been a washout and a loss.<br/><br/>The game is an opportunity for CHN to climb ahead of Rajasthan in the points table. RAJ have played two games more with the same number of wins. Clearly, CHN have been more consistent and they will be looking to extend their good form. That and the home advantage puts them slightly ahead.<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai<br/><br/><b>Date:</b> April 28, 2015<br/><br/><b>Time:</b> 2000 IST<br/><br/><b>Team news:</b><br/><br/><b>Chennai</b><br/><br/>The most settled looking team of the IPL has it as one of their biggest advantages. The team is packed with match-winners and in-form players that has made MS Dhoni's job a little easier. The return to form of Ravindra Jadeja with the ball solves that last bit of the jigsaw puzzle for them. Dwayne Smith and Brendon McCullum's contributions at the top have given CHN invaluable platforms to cash in. The duo are fourth and fifth in the list of leading run-getters this season while Ashish Nehra's vital strikes with the ball has come as a welcome surprise for the team. More than their batting might, it is the consistent showing with the ball that has lent the side a striking balance. Expect no changes for tomorrow's game unless there is an injury concern.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> Brendon McCullum, Dwayne Smith, Suresh Raina, Faf du Plessis, MS Dhoni (c & wk), Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohit Sharma, Ishwar Pandey, Ashish Nehra<br/><br/><b>Kolkata:</b><br/><br/>W, L, W, W, L, NR - That has been KOL's journey this season. Quite evidently it has been a see-saw tournament. The washout in the previous game did not help their cause of gathering momentum. The defending champions have been oddly hampered by things out of their control. With their previous two games being affected by rain, KOL will desperately need a good game under their belt to restart their defence of the title. The suspicion over their premier spinner Sunil Narine's action has only added to their woes. Will Narine be treated with caution now? Can KOL afford to sit him out as a precaution? Narine has been sent to the Chennai testing center but can play for now until the test results come out. Will KOL risk him though? Those are the toughest questions that the team management will have to answer. In case Narine doesn't play, Johan Botha could get another game.<br/><br/>They also need that one comprehensive performance with both batting and bowling clicking in unison. Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Suryakumar Yadav, Manish Pandey and Andre Russell have all had their moments this year but it is important for all of them to come together at the right time. If they do produce such a performance against the mighty CHN then that is exactly the kind of rejuvenation that will breathe fresh air to their campaign.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> Robin Uthappa (wk), Gautam Gambhir (c), Manish Pandey, Suryakumar Yadav, Yusuf Pathan, Andre Russell, Johan Botha, Piyush Chawla, Brad Hogg, Morne Morkel, Umesh Yadav<br/><br/><b>Stats:</b><br/><br/>CHN and KOL have played each other 15 times with CHN having a clear lead with nine wins.<br/><br/>CHN have also won four out of the six meetings in Chepauk.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Kolkata</b> (From): Gautam Gambhir(c), Robin Uthappa(w), Manish Pandey, Suryakumar Yadav, Yusuf Pathan, Andre Russell, Johan Botha, Piyush Chawla, Kuldeep Yadav, Morne Morkel, Umesh Yadav, Sunil Narine, Pat Cummins, Ryan ten Doeschate, Veer Pratap Singh, Azhar Mahmood, Brad Hogg, Sumit Narwal, Sheldon Jackson, Aditya Garhwal, Kishan Cariappa, Vaibhav Rawal]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Chennai</b> (From): Brendon McCullum, Dwayne Smith, Suresh Raina, Faf du Plessis, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohit Sharma, Ashish Nehra, Ishwar Pandey, Baba Aparajith, Matt Henry, Mithun Manhas, Pawan Negi, Samuel Badree, Ronit More, Michael Hussey, Rahul Sharma, Kyle Abbott, Ankush Bains, Irfan Pathan, Pratyush Singh, Andrew Tye, Eklavya Dwivedi]]></line>
