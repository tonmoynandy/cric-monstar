			<line><![CDATA[We are one match away from the final. MUM have already qualified and will be eager to find out who they will be facing at Eden Gardens on the 24th. CHN and BLR lock horns one more time this season, Chennai have had the better of Bangalore in the league stage. Will they keep it that way? Join us on Friday to find out. Until then, take care and Cya!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Below are some of the best <b>tweets</b> pertaining to this game...]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Sarang Bhalerao:</b> RAJ were in the game for the first 14 overs. From there on AB and Mandeep played gems and took the game away from #RAJ #BLRvsRAJ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Broken Cricket:</b> So It will be: India's Test Captain VS India's ODI Captain at Ranchi on Friday.

From 60 in 10 to 180 was brilliant. Good game set up vs CHN.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Harini Rana:</b> Oh #RAJ after a phenomenal season #IPL8 this wasn't the way to bow out. Completely outplayed #Pune by a very focussed and dangerous #BLR]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>ABD:</b> "I didn't perform that well in the last couple of innings. So, pretty hard on myself, happy that I got few runs today. I honestly don't know how we got to 180 when I was walking back after I got out. I was communicating with the boys and was looking at 140. The way Mandeep Singh played today, it is a man of the match performance, this trophy is going to him. There are no easy games in the IPL, CHN is a world class team and have won plenty of tournaments. For now, going to enjoy a beer with the boys."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>AB de Villiers</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his <b>38-ball 66.</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Kohli:</b> "Absolutely, it is just a semifinal for now. It was great to come across today. We know AB is the best batsman in the world, but that youngster (Mandeep) showed how special he is today and why we pulled him from Punjab. At one stage, after 7 overs I thought we should have bowled first. He (Starc) is good, the ground is a bit soft, even I am a bit stiff in the legs. He is fit and fine and he was just going through the motions towards the end. It was a great effort by the bowlers. This year we have played better cricket than the previous seasons. We have won crucial games, boys standing up and delivering for the team. A month and a half of good cricket and now it comes down to this."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Smith:</b> "A fair bit went wrong for us tonight. We started well with the ball, but lost it in the middle. AB and Mandeep took the game away from us. I thought 160 was a par score, they got bit more than that. We did have a good start to the tournament, but T20 is like that, we got into a bit of roll, but lost the momentum towards the end."]]></line><line><![CDATA[Earlier, de Villiers and Mandeep helped BLR to make  a smart recovery after they lost the wickets of Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli. Both of them played a flurry of sparkling shots and cracked fifties. On the other hand, RAJ's bowlers let the team down by losing the plot in the slog overs. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[After AB de Villiers and Mandeep Singh composed eye-catching knocks, BLR's bowlers put up a disciplined show to register a convincing win. With this comprehensive victory, BLR next will take on CHN in Qualifier 2 at Ranchi. While chasing down a sizeable target, RAJ struggled to string together partnerships as the game meandered towards a one-sided finish. Only Ajinkya Rahane played a handy innings.<br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Kohli is delighted as always. He quickly runs from the boundary rope to gather his team around. A fan comes running onto the ground and touches Kohli's feet. All smiles in the BLR camp as they make their way out of the middle.]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to D Kulkarni, <b>out</b> Bowled!! <b>BLR will take on CHN in Qualifier 2.</b> The wrong 'un from Chahal, Kulkarni backs away to the leg-side, doesn't seem to have picked it, goes for the drive, misses and the ball crashes into middle stump. <b>D Kulkarni b Chahal 3(9)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Chahal to D Kulkarni, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Bowled!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Ankit Sharma, 1 run, shortish and outside off, Ankit cuts it to extra cover, Mandy once again in action as he tumbles across to field the ball]]></line><line><![CDATA[18.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to D Kulkarni, 1 run, tossed up around off, Kulkarni kneels down and slog sweeps to deep mid-wicket, Mandy moves to his left, dives and stops it on the bounce.

The end is approaching for RAJ. Morris goes without troubling the scorers. Starc picks up his first of the game. Full and on off, Morris backs away and goes for the loft over mid-off, doesn't get the elevation and offers a simple catch to Chahal. <b>C Morris c Chahal b Starc 0(3)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Starc to C Morris, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to C Morris, no run, shortens the length as Morris gives the charge, the ball bounces a bit more and zips past the outside edge.

Hopefully, it is nothing serious as BLR need him for a few more days.]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to Deepak Hooda, no run, again, short and cramping the batsman for room, Hooda defends off the inner part to the right of the keeper]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to Deepak Hooda, 2 runs, short and outside off, Hooda stands tall and lifts it over extra cover for a couple]]></line><line><![CDATA[15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starc to Deepak Hooda, no run, Starc starts from round the wicket, on a length just outside off, Hooda steers it straight to the fielder at backward point]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Mitchell Starc [2.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[14.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aravind to C Morris, no run, slanted across the right-hander, Morris plays inside the line and is beaten all ends up.

RAJ falling apart. It was hara-kiri in the middle. Good length ball on the stumps, Binny takes a step out of the crease and misses the flick, the bowler and rest of the BLR players went up for an lbw appeal, but umpire Shamsuddin was not convinced. Meanwhile, Binny wanted the run and was halfway down the wicket before Hooda sent him back, the ball rolled towards point, Chahal gets to the ball and throws it to DK, who whips the bails off and catches Binny short of the crease. <b>Binny run out (Chahal/D Karthik) 0(1)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Aravind to Binny, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Run Out!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Stuart Binny, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Third umpire called in for a run-out check. Binny the man in question. He is struggling. OUT!]]></line><line><![CDATA[14.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aravind to Faulkner, <b>out</b> Caught&Bowled!! That might just be the game for BLR. Aravind knew straightaway that he had got Faulkner, he threw the ball up as soon as he completed the catch. It was a low full toss outside off, Faulkner goes for the heave, inside edges it onto the left boot, the ball pops up to the bowler, Aravind jumps to his left and takes it with both hands. That's an unlucky way to get out, but BLR won't mind it. <b>Faulkner c and b Aravind 4(4) [4s-1]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Aravind to Faulkner, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught&Bowled!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Aravind thinks he has got his man. BLR players seem confident. The umpires are going upstairs. Has the ball hit the turf before lobbing back to Aravind? He is fine with the no-ball. It seems to have come off the boot. Faulkner is in trouble. He is OUT!]]></line><line><![CDATA[14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aravind to Faulkner, no run, slower delivery angled across the right-hander, Faulkner goes for the swipe towards cow corner, misses it by a long way]]></line><line><![CDATA[14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aravind to Faulkner, <b>FOUR</b>, poor delivery and Faulkner is off the mark. Short and on leg-stump, Faulkner swivels and pulls it over backward square, no one protecting the fence behind square. So, it was easy pickings]]></line><line><![CDATA[14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aravind to Faulkner, <b>wide</b>, bumper on the stumps, Faulkner was winding up for the big hit, the ball is too high and is called a wide. Kohli is not happy with that decision]]></line><line><![CDATA[14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aravind to Faulkner, no run, short of length around off, Faulkner dabs it towards the keeper, DK is quick to swoop in on the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Sreenath Aravind [3.0-0-15-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>James Faulkner, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[13.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Rahane, <b>out</b> Caught by de Villiers!! RAJ have lost half their side and are heading out of the tournament. Floated up around off, Rahane kneels down and plays the slog sweep, the top-edge skies towards deep mid-wicket, AB snaffles it easily. Rahane had to go for it, but unfortunately he couldn't middle it. <b>Rahane c de Villiers b Chahal 42(39) [4s-4]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Chahal to Rahane, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[13.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Rahane, 2 runs, Chahal sees the batsman advances, drags the length back, punched it back to the bowler, Chahal misfields and allows the batsmen to come back for the second]]></line><line><![CDATA[13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Rahane, no run, googly around off, Rahane leans forward and works it to the right of the bowler, Chahal runs across, dives and makes a half stop, the batsmen don't risk the run]]></line><line><![CDATA[13.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Deepak Hooda, 1 run, pushed through on the pads, nurdled away to deep square leg]]></line><line><![CDATA[13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Rahane, 1 run, marginally short and outside off, Rahane cuts it towards cover-point, Wiese dives to his right and stops the ball]]></line><line><![CDATA[13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chahal to Rahane, no run, nicely tossed up delivery, Rahane presses forward and blocks it to the off-side]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Yuzvendra Chahal [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Time-out.</b> RAJ have to find the momentum from somewhere. Rahane has been batting for a while and they would want him to shift gears with the likes of Faulkner and Binny still waiting in the dugout.]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harshal Patel to Deepak Hooda, 2 runs, another off-speed delivery, Hooda works it square of the wicket on the leg-side, comes back for the second before the ball is hunted down]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harshal Patel to Deepak Hooda, no run, slower delivery and Hooda is cut into two. The off-cutter that grips the surface, Hooda presses forward and is beaten off the inside edge. The ball was not far away from the off-pole either]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harshal Patel to Deepak Hooda, no run, well directed bouncer, Hooda shuffles across and is late on the pull, misses it by a mile]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harshal Patel to Deepak Hooda, 2 runs, fuller and angling in, Hooda leans forward and chips it to the left of mid-on, Kohli gives chase from mid-off, slides and hauls it back in. Top effort from the BLR skipper, saved a couple of runs]]></line><line><![CDATA[A wide slip in place..]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harshal Patel to Deepak Hooda, no run, well that's a rare sight, at least at this stage of the innings, good length ball just outside off, Hooda lifts his bat and lets it go]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Deepak Hooda, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harshal Patel to Nair, <b>out</b> Caught by D Karthik!! Harshal strikes with the first ball in his new spell. RAJ's chase is going nowhere. Back of a length delivery with a bit of extra bounce, Karun goes for the cut, the ball takes the outside edge and DK does the rest. BLR are taking control of the game. It was too close to be playing that shot. <b>Nair c D Karthik b Harshal Patel 12(13) [4s-2]</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Harshal Patel to Nair, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Harshal Patel [2.0-0-11-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[11.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiese to Rahane, 2 runs, tad fuller and just outside off, Rahane pushes it with soft hands towards mid-on.

Width on offer from Aravind, Karun cracked it past point. The ball was racing away to the fence.

RAJ, however, made it to the play-offs winning a must-win encounter in their final league game, while BLR were denied a place in Qualifier 1 by the rain gods, and when the two teams clash in Pune for a place in Qualifier 2, there is no doubt who will start as the favourites.<br/><br/>Despite boasting an enviable batting line-up and a bowling unit led by the in-form Mitchell Starc, BLR would be well aware that the inaugural IPL champions and the tournament's perennial underdogs, Rajasthan, are not to be taken lightly.<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune<br/><b>Date:</b> May 20, 2015<br/><b>Time:</b> 20:00 IST<br/><b>Weather:</b> Bright and sunny with a high of 33 degree Celsius<br/><br/><b>Team News</b><br/><br/><b>Bangalore</b><br/><br/>Talk about peaking at the right time and with the likes of Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers scoring runs at will, BLR would not even think of tinkering with their batting line-up despite the poor run of form of Dinesh Karthik. Gayle, Kohli and de Villiers are among the top run-getters in the tournament and it will be tough for RAJ took overcome BLR if the trio fire. Ashok Dinda, who was given a chance in the last two league games failed to impress and in all likelihood the Bengal pacer will be replaced by Varun Aaron or Sreenath Aravind, provided Aravind recovers from his finger injury.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1. Chris Gayle, 2. Virat Kohli (captain), 3. AB de Villiers, 4. Dinesh Karthik (wicketkeeper), 5. Mandeep Singh, 6. Sarfaraz Khan, 7. David Wiese, 8. Mitchell Starc, 9. Harshal Patel, 10. Varun Aaron/Sreenath Aravind, 11. Yuzvendra Chahal.<br/><br/><b>Rajasthan</b><br/><br/>The return to form of Shane Watson, who helped RAJ book a place in play-offs with a scintillating 104 against Kolkata, has boosted the Jaipur-based franchise and along with Ajinkya Rahane, who is the second highest run-getter in the tournament so far, RAJ does have a top-order that can overcomethe threat of a certain Mitchell Starc. RAJ have been known to surprise their opponents and have been bold enough to change the combination for crucial games. Brainder Sran, who made his debut for RAJ in against KOL will in all likelihood willsit out in place of Pravin Tambe. Their chances of containing the powerful BLR batting unit will depend on the wily Chris Morris.<br/><br/>Probable XI: 1. Ajinkya Rahane, 2. Shane Watson, 3. Steven Smith (captain), 4. Sanju Samson (wicketkeeper), 5. James Faulkner, 6. Karun Nair, 7. Chris Morris, 8. Deepak Hooda, 9. Stuart Binny, 10. Dhawal Kulkarni, 11. Pravin Tambe. <br/><br/><b>Stats and Trivia</b><br/><br/>Both teams have played each other 14 times in IPL with Rajasthan and Bangalore winning seven each. The last encounter between the two was washed out.<br/><br/><b>Quotes</b><br/><br/>"A lot of the teams rely on their big stars to deliver. We believe we are a balanced side and don't necessarily rely on one or two individuals. We do have some stars and if they perform and win matches on their own, it's great," Rajsthan Rajasthan mentor, Rahul Dravid.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Rajasthan</b> (From): Shane Watson(c), Ajinkya Rahane, Steven Smith, Sanju Samson(w), Karun Nair, Deepak Hooda, James Faulkner, Stuart Binny, Chris Morris, Dhawal Kulkarni, Brainder Sran, Rajat Bhatia, Pravin Tambe, Abhishek Nayar, Ben Cutting, Dishant Yagnik, Vikramjeet Malik, Ankit Sharma, Rahul Tewatia, Dinesh Salunkhe, Rusty Theron, Pardeep Sahu, Sagar Trivedi]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Bangalore</b> (From): Virat Kohli(c), Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, Mandeep Singh, Dinesh Karthik(w), Sarfaraz Khan, David Wiese, Harshal Patel, Mitchell Starc, Ashok Dinda, Yuzvendra Chahal, Sreenath Aravind, Abu Nechim, Varun Aaron, Nic Maddinson, Vijay Zol, Sandeep Warrier, Yogesh Takawale, Rilee Rossouw, Iqbal Abdulla, Manvinder Bisla, S Badrinath, Darren Sammy, Sean Abbott, Jalaj Saxena, Shishir Bhavane]]></line>
