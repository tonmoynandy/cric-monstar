			<line><![CDATA[So folks, that's all we have for you from this game. Many thanks for your company. It was a pleasure bringing this game to you. Tomorrow, there's another double-header coming your way, with New Zealand locking horns with Afghanistan in the first game. The second game is the battle between the 2007 finalists, Australia and Sri Lanka. That game wil decide which team finishes 2nd or 3rd in Pool A. So join us tomorrow for all the cricketing action. On behalf of <b>Sriram, Mani</b>, my co-commentator <b>Akshay Maanay</b>, this is <b>Sidhant Maheshwari</b> signing off. Take care guys. Ciao!]]></line><line><![CDATA[What a thriller it was! It seems that the minnows are the ones providing us with all the entertainment in the World Cup. This was the third game between the lower ranked teams that went right down to the wire. Remember the Ireland-UAE game and the Afghanistan-Scotland encounter? This was right up there with those two matches in terms of a nail-biting finish.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Lets glance through some of the <b>tweets</b> from this game..]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@RoshanCricket:</b> Cusack prevails and so does @Irelandcricket with a win by 5 runs. Cricket the winner of course. Great chase and finish!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@mukundabhinav:</b> Well done the Irish ! The minnows giving us some cracker games this World Cup. Pity your football skills aren't great tho @niallnobiobrien!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@BrokenCricket:</b> Misbah Earlier, AB Later, Now Brendon Taylor. Its turning out to be a Captain's Day]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@cricket_U:</b> Ireland win by five runs. What a game! Irish are still in race to play Quarter Final...]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@RusselArnold69:</b> Great game .. But not sure of what exactly to say at the end of it all !!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@rgcricket:</b> 36.84- Ireland's win-percentage in World Cup- better than two Test playing countries- Bangladesh (34.48) & Zimbabwe (19.64)]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>@glennmcgrath11:</b> A nail biter sees @Irelandcricket get up over @ZimCricketv & move them into the top 4 in Pool B]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Ireland bowlers were once again put to the sword. They have now conceded more than 280 in all their four matches. But, credit to Alex Cusack, who was incredible in the death overs. The experienced medium pacer varied it nicely and kept the batsmen guessing. In the end, he ended with a 4-wicket haul. And also bowled the crucial final over which sealed the game in Ireland's favor. The difference might have been the fielding between the two sides, Ireland were better and held on to whatever chances came their way. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Williams heaved Kevin O'Brien towards deep mid-wicket, where Mooney claimed the catch. There was some confusion whether it was a clean take or not. But, Williams had already made his way out of the ground. The TV umpire took a long time and replays suggested that Mooney's left boot was in contact with the ad-cushions, but the decision could not be overturned as Williams had left the field. That changed the complexion of the game as Zimbabwe kept losing wickets. Mupariwa struck some meaty blows and brought the equation down to 7 off the last over. Cusack, however, kept his cool and picked up the remaining two wickets. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[Taylor looked in imperious touch. He used his feet beautifully to the spinners and was not afraid to take the aerial route. Some of the shots against Dockrell were simply outstanding. He managed to notch up his first ton since October 2011. And he looked set to finish the game off before a Cusack slower one had the better off him. Williams, though continued and kept the asking rate under check. However, a moment of drama saw the game change on it's head. <br/>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Zimbabwe did not get off to the best of starts. Raza and Chibhabha struggled at the beginning, but somehow managed to add 32. However, they lost three quick wickets, including that of Hamilton Masakadza. Taylor and Mire kept going for a while before the latter threw it away. That wicket brought Williams to the crease. He combined well with the stand-in skipper to stitch a 149-run stand for the 5th wicket. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Porterfield:</b> 'Obviously, ebbed and flowed, especially in the last 10. It's never really over, but we managed to get across the line, so we are pretty happy. Obviously, it was a very good score, but we knew that it was a very good wicket. It was going to be hard to defend, especially with the square boundaries being very short and a pretty quick outfield. We had to be on the money and thankfully, we got over the line. No, he didn't. I am not sure how he (Cusack) got there 4 for 20 odd or 30. So, fantastic effort from him to come in and put in a performance like that was great. I think it's very hard to tell when you're on the line, it is a great catch anyways. It's a great skill under pressure to catch it, I haven't seen the replay, I don't know, a couple of people have been talking about ever since we came off. I thought it was a great catch whether he (Mooney) did or didn't, but I thought it was a great skill anyway. Just to catch it. I thought I might have to run in and dive there, but managed to make up the ground. Thankfully, held onto it. It is still in our hands and we talk about it, we will go each game to game. There is 2 points up for grabs and I don't know what actually happened in the other group game to be honest, I am guessing South Africa lost but it's in our hands, we can go to Hamilton now and look to get 2 points there and that's our goal. That's what we have got to look forward to.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Taylor:</b> 'It's pretty frustrating to be in a winning situation again and just throwing it away a little bit. Ireland were a little bit more hungry and they deserved the win. I think so, we haven't been in that situation many times before, it hasn't been clever cricket from us at crucial periods, so that's hurting a lot. It's a tough one to swallow, but again credit to Ireland. Just poor really, that's the only word I can describe it, I don't think we were hungry in the field and I think our energy levels were low. These things I can't comprehend it is just really hurting me at the moment. I think we need to pull our socks up and try and finish with some pride. I hit it nicely but again getting out at the wrong time and a new batter coming in during the powerplay, those little things all add up. It was frustrating, but I would have liked to carry on. You got to take his word for it and then they zoomed in on it, but listen it looked pretty clear, but you take the fielder's word and the game moves forward (referring to Williams' dismissal). It's going to be a tough one at the Eden Park, but it's great to be in a World Cup, testing yourselves against the best players in the world. So, that's what it's all about.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ed Joyce</b>: 'We certainly did. We played the team with 3 spinners and 3 medium pacers. We know that we had to bowl really well and field really well to keep teams to a reasonable target. I thought it was a good toss to win for them, we would have bowled first as well and the chase was really hard to defend at the end and the boys did brilliantly in the end. He has got a, what's the word - cold heart, a 'cool head', that's the word I was looking for. He is a great guy to have a bowl in the last over. Obviously, they needed 7 with 2 wickets in hand. Two wickets left, you think the batting team have it in the bag, he's a top man and I was glad that he was the one bowling and I was glad that William Porterfield was the man, who was under the catch as well. I had a lot of luck early on before I got to 30 or 40, I probably needed that because they bowled well and there attack was suited to that wicket, and they bowled straight and back of a length, it was hard to get away. I took a few chances and obviously, got away with it. I ended up playing well towards the end, Andrew Balbirnie was fantastic as well, he has come into the team in the last 6 months to a year, and has been brilliant as a youngster.']]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ed Joyce</b> is the <b>Man of the Match</b> for his brilliant <b>103-ball 112</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[The Irish are extremely happy with this win. What a game it turned out to be! Porterfield congratulates Taylor on his knock and both the sides shake hands as the Irish team walk off the field. It was a very happy moment for the Irish, but the Zimbabweans suffer a heartbreak, they have faltered once again in the end.]]></line><line><![CDATA[49.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Mupariwa, <b>out</b> Caught by Porterfield!! Ireland clinch a thriller, they <b>beat Zimbabwe by just 5 runs</b>. The Zimbabweans will be distraught with this result, but contrasting show of fortune for Ireland as they celebrate their win. This is their 3rd win out of 4 games. Coming back to the ball, it was touch fuller and around off, Mupariwa went for the loft but completely mistimed it, Porterfield from long-on runs forward and takes a good low catch at the end. He throws the ball in the air in delight. <b>Mupariwa c Porterfield b Cusack 18(7) [4s-2 6s-1]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Cusack to Mupariwa, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[49.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Chatara, 1 run, slower delivery around off, Chatara pushes at it, gets an inside edge that rolls away behind square on the on-side, the batsmen charge to the other ends, Mupariwa is on strike now]]></line><line><![CDATA[Cusack has been asked to stop in his run-up.

Ohh no! Regis drags one back onto the stumps. It was the off-cutter from Cusack, Chakabva was down on his knee and was looking to slog it into the on-side, he gets an inside edge and the ball rolls away back onto the stumps. <b>Ireland need a wicket to win this and Zimbabwe need 7 to win</b>. <b>Chakabva b Cusack 17(16) [4s-1]</b>]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[Cusack to Chakabva, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Bowled!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Zimbabwe need <b>7 runs off 6 balls</b>. Can Ireland stop them? Or will Zimbabwe win their second game of the tournament and stay in the hunt for a quarter-final spot. If it is a tie, it will be a tie. There will be no Super Over.

Panyangara perishes and the game is heading towards a thrilling finish. It was the fuller one around middle and leg, Panyangara clears his front leg and mistimes the loft, picks out long-on, who takes a good low catch diving to his left. <b>Panyangara c Porterfield b J Mooney 5(5)</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[J Mooney to Panyangara, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[47.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Mooney to Panyangara, 2 runs, full and on off, Panyangara goes for the loft, but can't time it right, he just about manages to get it over the infield, the fielder at long-off was at the rope and he had no time of reaching there in time, the batsmen take a couple]]></line><line><![CDATA[47.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Mooney to Panyangara, 2 runs, fullish delivery on leg, Panyangara works it behind square for a couple]]></line><line><![CDATA[47.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J Mooney to Panyangara, no run, slower delivery outside off, Panyangara was looking to run it down to third man, can't connect and the ball goes on the bounce to the wicket keeper]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>John Mooney [9.0-0-53-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K O'Brien to Panyangara, 1 run, right in the blockhole, Panyangara squeezes it out off the inside half of the bat and the batsmen take a single]]></line><line><![CDATA[Coming back to the Williams wicket, even if the third umpire had to overrule the onfield decision, he couldn't have as Williams had already left the field. For the decision to be overturned, the batsman had to be on the ground. Still have no clue as to why Williams had left the field before a call was made. ]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Tinashe Panyangara, right handed bat, comes to the crease</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K O'Brien to Sean Williams, <b>out</b> Caught by J Mooney at deep mid wicket!! It was a fullish delivery on the stumps, Williams goes for the big heave and picks out Mooney at the deep mid-wicket boundary. However, that looked like a six as the ad skirting moved as Mooney moved his left leg after taking the catch. Well, the third umpire doesn't think so and he has deemed it out. It's just very confusing and he has been given out. <b>Sean Williams c J Mooney b K O'Brien 96(83) [4s-7 6s-2]</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[K O'Brien to Sean Williams, <b>THATS OUT!!</b> Caught!!]]></line><line><![CDATA[Is that a <b>six or is that out?</b> Mooney doesn't think so. The third umpire is checking whether the fielder at the rope was touching the ad cushion or not. It looks like there was a little movement on the ad skirting. It is a difficult one for the umpire and it could well decide the fortune of both the teams. Apparently, Williams has left the field and the new batsman is out. <b>Drama all over!</b> The decision has been made and he has been given <b>OUT!</b> Ohh dear! Will it cost Zimbabwe the match?]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K O'Brien to Sean Williams, 2 runs, angling in on middle and leg, Williams works it behind square and comes back for the second. good running from him]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K O'Brien to Sean Williams, no run, <b>run-out chance missed!</b> Williams was looking to work it away into the on-side, but fails to connect. He wears it on his pad and sets off, but O' Brien was quick to reach the ball, he picks it up and underarms the throw over the stumps, had there been a direct-hit, Williams was probably out of his ground]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K O'Brien to Chakabva, 1 run, full on the stumps, Chakabva works it to deep mid-wicket]]></line><line><![CDATA[46.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K O'Brien to Chakabva, <b>FOUR</b>, fullish delivery angling in on middle, Chakabva gets his front foot out of the way and heaves it to the right of long-on, who gave chase but the ball beats his dive and crashes into the fence]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Kevin O'Brien [8.0-0-63-1] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[45.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Sean Williams, 2 runs, full and wide outside off, Williams drills it towards deep extra cover, the batsmen take two]]></line><line><![CDATA[45.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Chakabva, leg byes, 3 runs, <b>comedy of errors!</b> It was a slower off-cutter on middle and leg, Chakabva fails to work it into the on-side and wears it on his pad and kicks it while he was going for the run, the batsmen go through as the ball rolls away to the left of the bowler. Both the batsmen were stranded in the middle of the crease as Cusack was charging towards the ball, he slips and it goes past him. The fielder from cover, Niall O'Brien then tries to play a little football and tried to kick the ball back at the non-striker's end, he also fails and there was no one backing up, the batsmen take two more extra runs on account of that]]></line><line><![CDATA[45.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Sean Williams, 1 run, angling away outside off, Williams bunts it towards cover and the batsmen pinch a quick single]]></line><line><![CDATA[45.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Chakabva, 1 run, length delivery just outside off, Chakabva drives it towards mid-off and charges towards the other end, the throw from the fielder comes in at the non-striker's end, but Chakabva makes it in with a dive]]></line><line><![CDATA[45.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Sean Williams, 1 run, low full toss just outside off, Williams mistimes the drive to long-off, the batsmen cross over]]></line><line><![CDATA[45.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cusack to Sean Williams, 2 runs, bowls this full and well outside off, Williams drives it through extra cover and the batsmen take two before the fielder from long-off runs to his right and collects the ball]]></line><end-of-over>end of over</end-of-over><line><![CDATA[<b>Alex Cusack [8.0-2-24-2] is back into the attack</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Zimbabwe need <b>49 off 30 balls</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[44.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy McBrine to Chakabva, no run, in the blockhole, Chakabva squeezes it out to the right of the bowler, where the mid-wicket fielder runs across to his left and prevents the single]]></line><line><![CDATA[44.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy McBrine to Sean Williams, 1 run, run-out chance, but Chakabva makes it in time, it was tossed up on middle and leg, Williams drags the sweep to short fine and sets off, the ball went quickly to the fielder who picks it up and fires in the throw, Chakabva was haring across and puts in the dive to get in the crease.

That cost us heavily. It's a new game and very excited to push for a good win."]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Porterfield:</b> "Not quite home as its snowing back home. But, it is nice and fresh. The conditions overhead might suggest to have a bowl, but it is a very good pitch and we expect it to be like that throughout. I think it is more the back end and it has happened quite a lot in the tournament, but that's when you try and be at the top of your game and try to limit damage as much as anything. Few things have gone our way and we have to got to come up with a plan to minimise that. Every game is a must win game. If we get that win today, it makes it 3 in 4."]]></line><line><![CDATA[So, who will win the toss? And who will bat first? Answers to these questions are coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Pitch report:</b> 'There should be good pace and bounce. There is even covering of grass, hardly any patches. The team batting second has had more success here. If you win the toss, one would like to put the opposition in,' reckons <b>Russell Arnold</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Weather Conditions:</b> It is a cloudy day in Hobart with some rain expected in the later in the evening. The maximum temperature is expected to be around 21 degress Celsius, with the minimum being around 12 degrees.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Team News:</b> Ireland might be tempted to bring in Alex Cusack for Max Sorensen, who went for 76 runs in just 6 overs against South Africa. However, none of their players are injured and it won't come as a surprise if they field the same XI as the last game. On the other hand, Zimbabwe will miss Chigumbura and Taylor will captain in his absence. Regis Chakabva is expected to replace Chigu in the line-up.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ireland</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[After consecutive wins against West Indies and UAE, Ireland were up against a strong South African side in the last game. The Irish bowled first and South Africa, riding on centuries from Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis, posted a mammoth total on the board. Rossouw and Miller also played crucial knocks at the fag end of the innings, helping South Africa post their successive 400+ score. With the bat, their run-chase never took off and they were struggling at 48/5 at one stage. Even though Balbirnie scored a fifty and Kevin O'Brien made 48, Ireland were bowled out for 210 at the end.]]></line><line><![CDATA[This is a must-win game for Ireland as their last two games are going to be extremely tough. If they win today, they will have 3 wins out of 4 games and if they manage to beat either India or Pakistan, they will be sure of a quarter-final spot. However, with just 3 wins as well, they will have a chance as then the net run-rate will come into the picture. Therefore, the Irish will leave no stone unturned to try and force a winning result out of this game.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Zimbabwe</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[Zimbabwe have played 4 games so far in the tournament. Even though they only have 2 points on the table, they have given a tough fight to their opponents from time to time. In their last game, they started off brilliantly with the ball, reducing Pakistan to 58/3 at one stage. However, fifties from Misbah-ul-Haq and Wahab Riaz helped Pakistan post a fighting 235 on the board. Zimbabwe were 74/2 at one stage and at that time, it looked like the game would go down to the wire. However, they kept losing wickets in heaps and eventually folded for 215, losing the game by just 20 runs.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Their only win came against UAE, a team that hasn't won any of their games. However, if they win their game today and the final game against India, they will also have an outside chance of qualifying for the next stage, but net run-rate will come into play. Their current net run-rate is not that bad, but they need to win today to put pressure on other teams. They will be without their regular captain Elton Chigumbura, who suffered a third grade quadriceps tear in the last game. In his absence, Brendan Taylor will captain the side.]]></line><line><![CDATA[Let's take a look at the recent form of both Ireland and Zimbabwe:]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST:</b> The race to the quarters is slowly gaining momentum and Ireland are still in the fray for the quarters spot. In fact, apart from the first 2 slots, the final two quarter-finals slots are still undecided and four teams - Pakistan, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe - are in with a chance of qualifying. For Ireland, it is imperative that they win today as their last 2 games are against India and Pakistan.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Preview:</b><br/><br/>Ireland have had a fruitful ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 campaign so far. Living up to their reputation of winning at least one big game, they did that against West Indies, and as expected, pulled off 21-run against UAE. However, their previous match against South Africa, where they suffered a 201-run loss, proved that lack of pace in their bowling attack remains a concern. Once South Africa scored above 400, and Ireland lost three wickets for some 20-odd runs, the outcome was a foregone conclusion despite their knack of chasing down big total. <br/><br/>With the bottom-half of Pool B setting up nicely, the Irish are still in with a chance of qualifying to the knock-outs. They already have two wins and a game extra in hand, as compared to Zimbabwe, who they face at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Saturday.<br/><br/>Zimbabwe haven't played Ireland in four years and with just one win in four matches, their chances of making the quarter finals are very slim. A win for them might not make a big difference, but since Ireland are due to face Pakistan and India, the equation might come down to their last league game. Captaining them this time around will be Brendan Taylor, since Elton Chigumbura suffered a third grade quadriceps tear on Sunday, and is set to be out for a bit. The last time these two teams faced each other in a World Cup - at Jamaica in 2007 - the match ended in a thrilling tie.<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Bellerive Oval<br/><br/><b>Date and Time:</b> March 7, Start time: 9 AM<br/><br/><b>Weather:</b> A maximum temperature of 24 with chances of shower later in the day<br/><br/><b>Conditions:</b> The venue will host its first game of the 2015 World Cup and expect to see plenty of runs with some carry and bounce.<br/><br/><b>Team News</b><br/><br/>Ireland are carrying a fully fit side, which means that chances of making alterations are quite slim. However, they might be tempted to bring in Alex Cusack in place of Max Sorensen, who conceded 76 runs from six overs against South Africa. The option to replacing a medium-pacer with another medium-pacer will make more sense considering the bouncy nature of the wicket.<br/><br/>The injury to Chigumbura means that there is a strong possibility of Regis Chakabva to come back in the Zimbabwe Playing XI. His scores so far in the tournament have been: 35 against West Indies and 2 against UAE.<br/><br/><b>Players to watch out for</b><br/><br/>He has already produced a match-winning 92 against West Indies and <b>Paul Stirling</b> will fancy his chances against this opposition. The last time these two teams collided in an ICC event, it was during the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, where his 34-ball 60 took the match away. Failures against UAE and South Africa mean he will try and make amends on Saturday. His contribution at the top will stitch a nice platform for Kevin O'Brien to set up a late impetus and the fact that he recently rose to the 34th place in the ICC ODI batting rankings will do his confidence a world of good.<br/><br/>Two identical scores of 76 against West Indies and UAE have made <b>Sean Williams</b> Zimbabwe's leading run-scorer this World Cup. In the absence of skipper Elton Chigumbura, his responsibilities increase. Against Pakistan too, just when he seemed to be getting in the groove, he was dismissed for 33. The signs though are ominous and he will take confidence from the fact that he scored a crucial 74 when he last played Ireland in 2010.<br/><br/><b>Captains' take</b><br/><br/><b>Brendan Taylor:</b> We feel we are 80 percent there. We think if we can close that gap a little bit more, I think we are heading in the right direction for a good win against Ireland. Against Pakistan, we needed a partnership but unfortunately 50 and 30-run partnerships won't get you over the line. It is extremely difficult to comprehend this loss. We were cruising nicely but again we found ways to get out at crucial periods - some soft dismissals as well. That's been a major downfall for us in the last four games, crucial periods when batters have needed to get through those initial periods, then finding ways to get out. It's not helping the team's cause.<br/><br/><b>William Porterfield:</b> You've got to put it [the loss against South Africa] behind you pretty quickly. The tournament's back-end fixtures come pretty quickly. Every game is a two-pointer for us and Hobart is no different. Two points are up for grabs and they are a pretty big two points for us. Whatever the outcome of Saturday's match, it will do well to match the excitement of Ireland and Zimbabwe's only previous World Cup encounter when the teams played out a thrilling tie at Sabina Park, Kingston, during the 2007 edition in the Caribbean.]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Teams:</b>]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Zimbabwe</b> (From): Regis Chakabva, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(c/w), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Solomon Mire, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Chamu Chibhabha, Prosper Utseya]]></line><line><![CDATA[<b>Ireland</b> (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Max Sorensen, Andy McBrine, Peter Chase, Alex Cusack, Stuart Thompson, Craig Young]]></line>
